`#pragma` declarations are a mark of craftsmanship in Objective-C. Although originally used to make source code compatible between different compilers, the Xcode-savvy coder uses `#pragma` declarations to very different ends.

In this modern context, `#pragma` skirts the line between comment and code. As a preprocessor directive, `#pragma` evaluates at compile-time. But unlike other macros, such as `#ifdef...#endif`, the way `#pragma` is used will not change the runtime behavior of your application. Instead, `#pragma` declarations are used by Xcode to accomplish two primary tasks: organizing code and inhibiting compiler warnings.

> In addition to the `#pragma` syntax, both [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Pragmas.html) and [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-diagnostics-via-pragmas) have added the C99 `_Pragma` operator.

## Organizing Your Code

Code organization is a matter of hygiene. How you structure your code is a reflection on you and your work. A lack of convention and internal consistency indicates either carelessness or incompetence--and worse, makes a project difficult to maintain and collaborate on.

Good habits start with `#pragma mark`. Like so:

~~~{objective-c}
@implementation ViewController

- (id)init {
  ...
}

#pragma mark - UIViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
  ...
}

#pragma mark - IBAction

- (IBAction)cancel:(id)sender {
  ...
}

#pragma mark - UITableViewDataSource

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
  ...
}

#pragma mark - UITableViewDelegate

- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
  ...
}
~~~

Use `#pragma mark` in your `@implementation` to divide code into logical sections. Not only do these sections make it easier to read through the code itself, but it also adds visual cues to the Xcode source navigator (`#pragma mark` declarations starting with a dash (`-`) are preceded with a horizontal divider).

If your class conforms to any `@protocols`, start by grouping all of the methods within each protocol together, and adding a `#pragma mark` header with the name of that protocol. Another good convention is to group subclassed methods according to their respective superclass. For example, an `NSInputStream` subclass should have a group marked `NSInputStream`, followed by a group marked `NSStream`. Things like `IBAction` outlets, or methods corresponding to target / action, notification, or KVO selectors probably deserve their own sections as well.

Your code should be clean enough to eat off of. So take the time to leave your `.m` files better than how you found them.

## Inhibiting Warnings

`#pragma mark` is pretty mainstream. On the other hand, `#pragma` declarations to inhibit warnings from the compiler & static analyzer--now that's pretty fresh.

You know what's even more annoying than poorly-formatted code? Code that generates warnings. Especially 3rd-party code. There are few things as irksome as that one vendor library that takes forever to compile, and finishes with 200+ warnings. Even shipping code with 1 warning is in poor form.

> Pro tip: Try setting the `-Weverything` flag and checking the "Treat Warnings as Errors" box your build settings. This turns on Hard Mode in Xcode.

But sometimes there's no avoiding compiler warnings. Deprecation notices and retain-cycle false positives are two common situations where this might happen. In those rare cases where you are _absolutely_ certain that a particular compiler or static analyzer warning should be inhibited, `#pragma` comes to the rescue:

~~~{objective-c}
// completionBlock is manually nilled out in AFURLConnectionOperation to break the retain cycle.
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Warc-retain-cycles"
    self.completionBlock = ^ {
        ...
    };
#pragma clang diagnostic pop
~~~

This code sample [from AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/blob/master/AFNetworking/AFHTTPRequestOperation.m#L247) (contributed by [Peter Steinberger](https://github.com/steipete)) is an example of an otherwise unavoidable warning from the static analyzer. Clang notices a strong reference to `self` within the block, and warns about a possible [retain cycle](http://www.quora.com/What-is-a-retain-cycle). However, the `super` implementation of `setCompletionBlock` takes care of this by `nil`-ing out the strong reference after the completion block is finished.

Fortunately, Clang provides a convenient way to get around all of this. Using `#pragma clang diagnostic push/pop`, you can tell the compiler to ignore certain warnings, _only_ for a particular section of code (the original diagnostic settings are restored with the final `pop`).

> You can read more about the LLVM's use of `#pragma` in the [Clang Compiler User's Manual](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#diagnostics_pragmas).

Just don't use this as a way to sweep legitimate warnings under the rug--that will only come back to bite you later.

So there you go: two ways you can markedly improve your code using `#pragma` declarations.

Like the thrift store 8-track player you turned into that lamp in the foyer, `#pragma` remains a curious vestige of the past: Once the secret language of compilers, now re-purposed to better-communicate intent to other programmers. How delightfully vintage!
