NSHipster Pub Quiz came to New York City on July 30th. Like our [first](http://nshipster.com/nshipster-quiz-1/) and [second](http://nshipster.com/nshipster-quiz-2/) quizzes, questions ranged from random Apple trivia to obscure framework questions—this time, with a particular focus on hardware rumors and questions about iOS [REDACTED].

The event was hosted by [Meetup](http://meetup.com), and sponsored by [Heroku](https://heroku.com). Dozens of the best and brightest minds in Objective-C attended the event, with the team "The Forstall Five" ([@mb](https://twitter.com/mb), [@bcapps](https://twitter.com/bcapps), [@ethicalpaul](https://twitter.com/ethicalpaul), [@grantjbutler](https://twitter.com/grantjbutler), and [@conbrolution](https://twitter.com/conbrolution)) taking first place.

If you'd like to play along at home, or test your team's mettle at work, here are some guidelines:

- There are 4 Rounds, with 10 questions each
- Record answers on a separate sheet of paper
- Each correct answer to a question gets you 1 point (unless otherwise specified)
- Play with up to 5 friends for maximum enjoyment
- Don't be lame and look things up on the Internet or in Xcode

3. According to a leaked photo from Chinese site WeiPhone, what is the name of the rumored low-cost, plastic iPhone?
4. JOBS, starring Ashton Kutcher hits theaters August 16... but which acclaimed screenwriter is behind the other Steve Jobs biopic, currently in production?

There are 152 frameworks in iOS. You may know of perhaps a few dozen public ones, but there are many more private frameworks hidden in the OS. For each of the following, tell me if the framework (as of iOS 6.1) is public, private, or something we just made up.

1. ActorKit
2. Celestial
3. MediaToolbox

8. QuickLook
9. AdSupport
10. NSAKit


Round 3: Picture Round - Name that App!

With over 1 Million iOS & Mac Apps on the App Store, it's clear that the true secret to success boils down to one thing: having a pretty icon. For each icon, tell me the name of the app.
