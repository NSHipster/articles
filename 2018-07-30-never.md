"Never" is a proposition that an event doesn't occur
at any time in the past or future.
It's logical impossibility with a time axis;
nothingness stretching out in all directions, forever.

...which is why it's especially worrisome to encounter
[this comment](https://github.com/search?q=%22this+will+never+happen%22&type=Code)
in code:

```swift
// this will never happen
```

Every compiler textbook will tell you that
a comment like this one can't and won't affect the behavior of compiled code.
[Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) says otherwise.

How does Swift keep us safe in the unpredictable chaos that is programming?
You'll never believe the answer:
**nothing** and **crashing**.

`Never` was proposed as a replacement for the `@noreturn` attribute in
[SE-0102: "Remove @noreturn attribute and introduce an empty Never type"](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0102-noreturn-bottom-type.md),
by [Joe Groff](https://github.com/jckarter).

Prior to Swift 3,
functions that stop execution, like
`fatalError(_:file:line:)`,
`abort()`, and
`exit(_:)`,
were annotated with the `@noreturn` attribute,
which told the compiler that there was no return to the call site.

```swift
// Swift < 3.0
@noreturn func fatalError(_ message: () -> String = String(),
                               file: StaticString = #file,
                               line: UInt = #line)
```

After the change,
`fatalError` and its trapping cohorts
were declared to return the `Never` type:

```swift
// Swift >= 3.0
func fatalError(_ message: @autoclosure () -> String = String(),
                     file: StaticString = #file,
                     line: UInt = #line) -> Never
```

For a type to replace the functionality of an annotation,
it must be pretty complex, right?
Nope! Actually, just the opposite ---
`Never` is arguably the simplest type in the entire Swift standard library:

```swift
enum Never {}
```

## Uninhabited Types

`Never` is an <dfn>uninhabited</dfn> type,
which means that it has no values.
Or to put it another way, uninhabited types can't be constructed.

Enumerations with no cases
are the most common example of an uninhabited type in Swift.
Unlike structures or classes,
enumerations don't receive an initializer.
And unlike protocols,
enumerations are concrete types
that can have properties, methods, generic constraints, and nested types.
Because of this,
uninhabited enumeration types are used throughout the Swift standard library
to do things like
[namespace functionality](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/a4230ab2ad37e37edc9ed86cd1510b7c016a769d/stdlib/public/core/Unicode.swift#L918)
and
[reason about types](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/a6952decab6f918a9df3c6fa342153a9f9204f8e/stdlib/public/core/MemoryLayout.swift#L43).

But `Never` isn't like that.
It doesn't have any fancy bells or whistles.
It's special by virtue of it being what it is (or rather, isn't).

Consider a function declared to return an uninhabited type:
Because uninhabited types don't have any values,
the function can't return normally.
(Because how could they?)
Instead, the function must either stop execution or run indefinitely.

## Eliminating Impossible States in Generic Types

Sure, this is interesting from a theoretical perspective,
but what practical use does `Never` have for us?

Not much ---
or at least not before the acceptance
[SE-0215: Conform Never to Equatable and Hashable](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0215-conform-never-to-hashable-and-equatable.md#conform-never-to-equatable-and-hashable).

In his proposal,
[Matt Diephouse](https://github.com/mdiep) explains the motivation behind
conforming this obscure type to `Equatable` and other protocols this way:

> `Never` is very useful for representing impossible code.
> Most people are familiar with it as the return type of functions like `fatalError`,
> but `Never` is also useful when working with generic classes.
> For example, a `Result` type might use `Never` for its `Value`
> to represent something that always errors
> or use `Never` for its `Error` to represent something that never errors.

Swift doesn't have a standard `Result` type,
but most of them look something like this:

```swift
enum Result<Value, Error> {
    case success(Value)
    case failure(Error)
}
```

`Result` types are used to encapsulate values and errors
produced by functions that execute asynchronously
(whereas synchronous functions can use `throws` to communicate errors).

For example,
a function that makes an asynchronous HTTP request might use a `Result` type
to wrap either a response and data or an error:

```swift
func fetch(_ request: URLRequest,
          completion: (Result<(URLResponse, Data), Error>) -> Void) {
    <#...#>
}
```

When calling that method,
you'd switch over `result` to handle `.success` and `.failure` separately:

```swift
fetch(request) { result in
    switch result {
    case let .success(response, _):
        print("Success: \(response)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failure: \(error)")
    }
}
```

Now consider a function that's guaranteed to always return a successful result
in its completion handler:

```swift
func alwaysSucceeds(_ completion: (Result<String, Never>) -> Void) {
    completion(.success("yes!"))
}
```

By specifying `Never` as the result's `Error` type,
we're using the type system to signal that failure is not an option.
What's really cool about this
is that Swift is smart enough to know that
you don't need to handle `.failure` for the `switch` statement to be exhaustive:

```swift
alwaysSucceeds { (result) in
    switch result {
    case .success(let string):
        print(string)
    }
}
```

You can see this effect played out to its logical extreme
in the implementation conforming `Never` to `Comparable`:

```swift
extension Never: Comparable {
  public static func < (lhs: Never, rhs: Never) -> Bool {
    switch (lhs, rhs) {}
  }
}
```

Because `Never` is an uninhabited type,
there aren't any possible values of it.
So when we switch over `lhs` and `rhs`,
Swift understands that there aren't any missing cases.
And since all cases ---
of which there aren't any ---
return `Bool`,
the method compiles without a problem.
_Neat!_

## Never as a Bottom Type

As a corollary,
the original Swift Evolution proposal for `Never`
hints at the theoretical usefulness of the type with further enhancement:

> An uninhabited type can be seen as a subtype of any other type ---
> if evaluating an expression never produces a value,
> it doesn't matter what the type of that expression is.
> If this were supported by the compiler,
> it would enable some potentially useful things...

### Unwrap or Die

The forced unwrap operator (`!`)
is one of the most controversial parts of Swift.
At best, it's a necessary evil.
At worst, it's a code smell that suggests sloppiness.
And without additional information,
it can be really tough to tell the difference between the two.

For example,
consider the following code that assumes `array` to not be empty:

```swift
let array: [Int]
let firstIem = array.first!
```

To avoid force-unwrapping,
you could use a `guard` statement with conditional assignment instead:

```swift
let array: [Int]
guard let firstItem = array.first else {
    fatalError("array cannot be empty")
}
```

In the future,
if `Never` is implemented as a bottom type,
it could be used in the right-hand side of nil-coalescing operator expression.

```swift
// Future Swift? ðŸ”®
let firstItem = array.first ?? fatalError("array cannot be empty")
```

If you're really motivated to adopt this pattern today,
you can manually overload the `??` operator thusly (however...):

```swift
func ?? <T>(lhs: T?, rhs: @autoclosure () -> Never) -> T {
    switch lhs {
    case let value?:
        return value
    case nil:
        rhs()
    }
}
```

In the [rationale](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0217-the-unwrap-or-die-operator/14107/222)
for [SE-0217: Introducing the !! "Unwrap or Die" operator to the Swift Standard Library](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0217-bangbang.md#on-forced-unwraps),
[Joe Groff](https://github.com/jckarter) notes that
"[...] We found that overloading [?? for Never]
had unacceptable impact on type-checking performance...".
Therefore, it's recommended that you don't add this to your codebase.

{% endinfo %}

### Expressive Throw

Similarly,
if `throw` is changed from being a statement
to an expression that returns `Never`,
you could use `throw` on the right-hand side of `??`:

```swift
// Future Swift? ðŸ”®
let firstItem = array.first ?? throw Error.empty
```

### Typed Throws

Looking even further down the road:
If the `throws` keyword in function declarations
added support for type constraints,
then the `Never` type could be used to indicate that a function won't throw
(similar to the `Result` example before):

```swift
// Future Swift? ðŸ”®
func neverThrows() throws<Never> {
    <#...#>
}

neverThrows() // `try` unnecessary because it's guaranteed to succeed (perhaps)
```

Making a claim that something will never be the case
can feel like an invitation for the universe to prove otherwise.
Whereas modal or doxastic logics
allow for face-saving compromise
(_"it was true at the time, or so I believed!"_),
temporal logic seems to hold propositions to a higher standard.

Fortunately for us,
Swift lives up to this higher standard thanks to the unlikeliest of types,
`Never`.
