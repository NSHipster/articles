It's hard to get excited when new features come to Objective-C.
These days,
any such improvements are in service of Swift interoperability
rather than an investment in the language itself
_(see [nullability](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=25)
and [lightweight generics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/using_imported_lightweight_generics_in_swift))_.
So it was surprising to learn about
[this recently merged patch to Clang](https://reviews.llvm.org/D69991),
which adds a new direct dispatch mechanism to Objective-C methods.

The genesis of this new language feature is unclear;
the most we have to go on is an Apple-internal [Radar number](/bug-reporting/)
([`2684889`](rdar://2684889)),
which doesn't tell us much beyond its relative age
(sometime in the early '00s, by our estimation).

Fortunately,
[the feature landed](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/d4e1ba3fa9dfec2613bdcc7db0b58dea490c56b1)
with enough documentation and test coverage
to get a good idea of how it works.
_(Kudos to implementor Pierre Habouzit,
review manager John McCall,
and the other LLVM contributors)_.

This week on NSHipster,
we're taking this occasion to review Objective-C method dispatching
and try to understand the potential impact of this new language feature
on future codebases.

Direct methods could show up as early as Xcode 11.x,
but most likely, it'll be announced at WWDC 2020.

To understand the significance of direct methods,
you need to know a few things about the Objective-C runtime.
But let's start our discussion one step before that,
to the origin of <abbr title="object-oriented programming">OOP</abbr> itself:

## Object-Oriented Programming

Alan Kay coined the term <dfn>"object-oriented programming</dfn> in the late 1960s.
With the help of Adele Goldberg, Dan Ingalls, and his other colleagues at
Xerox <abbr title="Palo Alto Research Center">PARC</abbr>,
Kay put this idea into practice in the '70s
with the creation of the Smalltalk programming language.

<aside class="parenthetical">

During this time, researches at Xerox PARC also developed the
[Xerox Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto),
which would become the inspiration for Apple's Macintosh
and all other <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> computers.

</aside>

In the 1980s,
Brad Cox and Tom Love started work the first version of Objective-C,
a language that sought to take the object-oriented paradigm of Smalltalk
and implement it on solid fundamentals of C.
Through a series of fortuitous events in the '90s,
the language would come to be the official language of NeXT,
and later, Apple.

For those of us who started learning Objective-C in the iPhone era,
the language was often seen as yet another proprietary Apple technology ---
one of a myriad, obscure byproducts of the company's
["Not invented here"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)
(<abbr title="not invented here">NIH</abbr>) culture.
However,
Objective-C isn't just "an object-oriented C",
it's one of _the original_ object-oriented languages,
with as strong a claim to <abbr>OOP</abbr> credentials as any other.

Now, what does <abbr>OOP</abbr> mean?
That's a good question.
'90s era hype cycles have rendered the term almost meaningless.
However,
for our purposes today,
let's focus on something Alan Kay wrote in 1998:

> term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to

## Dynamic Dispatch and the Objective-C Runtime

In Objective-C,
a program consists of a collection of objects
that interact with each other by passing messages that, in turn,
invoke <dfn>methods</dfn>, or functions.
This act of message passing is denoted by square bracket syntax:

```objc
[someObject aMethod:withAnArgument];
```

When Objective-C code is compiled,
message sends are transformed into calls to a function called
[`objc_msgSend`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1456712-objc_msgsend)
(literally _"send a message to some object with an argument"_).

```objc
objc_msgSend(object, @selector(message), withAnArgument);
```

- The first argument is the receiver (`self` for instance methods)
- The second argument is `_cmd`: the selector, or name of the method
- Any method parameters are passed as additional function arguments

`objc_msgSend` is responsible for determining
which underlying implementation to call in response to this message,
a process known as <dfn>method dispatch</dfn>.

In Objective-C,
each class (`Class`) maintains a dispatch table to resolve messages sent at runtime.
Each entry in the dispatch table is a method (`Method`)
that keys a selector (`SEL`)
to a corresponding implementation (`IMP`),
which is a pointer to a C function.
When an object receives a message,
it consults the dispatch table of its class.
If it can find an implementation for the selector,
the associated function is called.
Otherwise,
the object consults the dispatch table of its superclass.
This continues up the inheritance chain until a match is found
or the root class (`NSObject`) deems the selector to be unrecognized.

If all of this indirection sounds like a lot of work,
in a way,
you'd be right!

<aside class="parenthetical">

And that's to say nothing of how Objective-C lets you do things like
replace method implementations and create new classes
dynamically at runtime.
It's absolutely wild what you can do.

</aside>

If you have a hot path in your code ---
a method that's called frequently,
accounting for a significant portion of execution time ---
you could imagine some benefit to avoiding all of this indirection.
To that end,
some developers have used C functions as a way around dynamic dispatch.

## Direct Dispatch with a C Function

As we saw with `objc_msgSend`,
any method invocation can be represented by an equivalent function
by passing implicit `self` as the first argument.

For example,
consider the following declaration of an Objective-C class
with a conventional, dynamically-dispatched method.

```objc
@interface MyClass: NSObject
- (void)dynamicMethod;
@end
```

If a developer wanted to implement some functionality on `MyClass`
without going through the whole message sending shebang,
they could declare a static C function
that took an instance of `MyClass` as an argument.

```objc
static void directFunction(MyClass *__unsafe_unretained object);
```

Here's how each of these approaches translates to the call site:

```objc
MyClass *object = [[[MyClass] alloc] init];

// Dynamic Dispatch
[object dynamicMethod];

// Direct Dispatch
directFunction(object);
```

## Direct Methods

A <dfn>direct method</dfn> has the look and feel of a conventional method,
but has the behavior of a C function.
When a direct method is called,
it directly calls its underlying implementation
rather than going through `objc_msgSend`.

With this new LLVM patch,
you now have a way to annotate Objective-C methods
to avoid participation in dynamic dispatch selectively.

### objc_direct, @property(direct), and objc_direct_members

To make an instance or class method direct,
you can mark it with the `objc_direct`
[Clang attribute](/__attribute__/).
Likewise,
the methods for an Objective-C property can be made direct
by declaring it with the `direct` property attribute.

```objc
@interface MyClass: NSObject
@property(nonatomic) BOOL dynamicProperty;
@property(nonatomic, direct) BOOL directProperty;

- (void)dynamicMethod;
- (void)directMethod __attribute__((objc_direct));
@end
```

{% info %}

By our count,
the addition of `direct` brings the total number of `@property` attributes to 16:

- `getter` and
  `setter`
- `readwrite` and
  `readonly`,
- `atomic` and
  `nonatomic`
- `weak`,
  `strong`,
  `copy`,
  `retain`, and
  `unsafe_unretained`
- `nullable`,
  `nonnullable`, and
  `null_resettable`
- `class`

{% endinfo %}

When an `@interface` for
a category or class extension is annotated with the `objc_direct_members` attribute,
all method and property declarations contained within it
are considered to be direct,
unless previously declared by that class.

{% warning %}

You can't annotate the primary class interface
with the `objc_direct_members` attribute.

{% endwarning %}

```objc
__attribute__((objc_direct_members))
@interface MyClass ()
@property (nonatomic) BOOL directExtensionProperty;
- (void)directExtensionMethod;
@end
```

Annotating an `@implementation` with `objc_direct_members` has a similar effect,
causing non-previously declared members to be deemed direct,
including any implicit methods resulting from property synthesis.

```objc
__attribute__((objc_direct_members))
@implementation MyClass
- (BOOL)directProperty {<#...#>}
- (void)dynamicMethod {<#...#>}
- (void)directMethod {<#...#>}
- (void)directExtensionMethod {<#...#>}
- (void)directImplementationMethod {<#...#>}
@end
```

{% error %}

A dynamic method can't be overridden in a subclass by a direct method,
and a direct method can't be overridden at all.

Protocols can't declare direct method requirements,
and a class can't implement a protocol requirement
with a direct method.

{% enderror %}

Applying these annotations to our example from before,
we can see how direct and dynamic methods are indistinguishable at the call site:

```objc
MyClass *object = [[[MyClass] alloc] init];

// Dynamic Dispatch
[object dynamicMethod];

// Direct Dispatch
[object directMethod];
```

---

Direct methods seem like a slam dunk feature
for the performance-minded developers among us.
But here's the twist:

**In most cases,
making a method direct probably won't have a noticeable performance advantage.**

As it turns out,
[`objc_msgSend` is surprisingly fast](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2016-04-15-performance-comparisons-of-common-operations-2016-edition.html).
Thanks to aggressive caching, extensive low-level optimization,
and intrinsic performance characteristics of modern processors,
`objc_msgSend` has an extremely low overhead.

We're long past the days when iPhone hardware
could reasonably be described as a resource-constrained environment.
So unless Apple is preparing for a new embedded platform
_([AR glasses, anyone?](http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/01/09/rumor-apple-working-with-carl-zeiss-on-ar-glasses-to-debut-in-2018))_,
the most reasonable explanation we have for
Apple implementing Objective-C direct methods in 2019
stems from something other than performance.

{% info %}

Mike Ash is the Internet's foremost expert on `objc_msgSend`.
Over the years,
his posts have provided the deepest and most complete understanding
to the Objective-C runtime you'll find outside of Cupertino.
For the curious
["Dissecting objc_msgSend on ARM64"](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-06-30-dissecting-objc_msgsend-on-arm64.html)
is a great place to start.

{% endinfo %}

## Hidden Motives

When an Objective-C method is marked as direct,
its implementation has hidden visibility.
That is,
direct methods can only be called within the same module
_(or to be pedantic,
<dfn>[linkage unit](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LTOVisibility.html)</dfn>)._
It won't even show up in the Objective-C runtime.

Hidden visibility has two direct advantages:

- Smaller compiled binary size
- No external invocation

Without external visibility
or a way to invoke them dynamically from the Objective-C runtime,
direct methods are effectively private methods.
That means no more [swizzling](/method-swizzling/),
and no more private API usage.

{% info %}

If you want to participate in direct dispatch,
but still want to make your API accessible externally,
you can wrap it in a C function.

```objc
static inline void performDirectMethod(MyClass *__unsafe_unretained object) {
    [object directMethod];
}
```

{% endinfo %}

---

You could imagine that,
from now until next year's developer conference,
a few engineers could go through each of the SDK frameworks,
annotating private methods with `objc_direct`
and private classes with `objc_direct_members`
as a lightweight, progressive way to tighten up private APIs.

If that's true,
then perhaps it's just as well that we've become skeptical of new Objective-C features.
When they're not in service of Swift,
they're in service of Apple.
Despite its important place in the history of programming and Apple itself,
it's hard not to see Objective-C as just that --- _history_.
