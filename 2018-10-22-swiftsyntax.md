[SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax) is a Swift library
that lets you parse, analyze, generate, and transform Swift source code.
It's based on the
[libSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/lib/Syntax) library,
and was spun out from the main Swift language repository
[in August 2017](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/commit/909d336aefacdcbdd45ec6130471644c1ae929f5).

Together, the goal of these projects is to provide
safe, correct, and intuitive facilities for <dfn>structured editing</dfn>,
which is described [thusly](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/Syntax/README.md#swift-syntax-and-structured-editing-library):

> What is structured editing?
> It's an editing strategy that is keenly aware of the _structure_ of source code,
> not necessarily its _representation_ (i.e. characters or bytes).
> This can be achieved at different granularities:
> replacing an identifier,
> changing a call to global function to a method call,
> or indenting and formatting an entire source file based on declarative rules.

At the time of writing,
SwiftSyntax is still in development and subject to API changes.
But you can start using it today to work with Swift source code
in a programmatic way.

It's currently used by the
[Swift Migrator](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/lib/Migrator),
and there are ongoing efforts to adopt the tool,
both internally and externally.

## How Does It Work?

To understand how SwiftSyntax works,
let's take a step back and look at the Swift compiler architecture:

{% asset swift-compilation-diagram.png alt="Swift Compiler Architecture Diagram"%}

The Swift compiler is primarily responsible for
turning Swift code into executable machine code.
The process is divided up into several discrete steps,
starting with the
[parser](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/lib/Parse),
which generates an abstract syntax tree,
(<abbr title="Abstract Syntax Tree">AST</abbr>).
From there, semantic analysis is performed on the syntax
to produce a type-checked AST,
which lowered into
[Swift Intermediate Language](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/SIL.rst);
the <abbr title="Swift Intermediate Language">SIL</abbr>
is transformed and optimized and itself lowered into
[LLVM IR](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html),
which is ultimately compiled into machine code.

The most important takeaway for our discussion
is that SwiftSyntax operates on the AST generated
at the first step of the compilation process.
As such, it can't tell you any semantic or type information about code.

Contrast this with something like
[SourceKit](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/tools/SourceKit),
which operates with a much more complete understanding of Swift code.
This additional information can be helpful for implementing editor features
like code-completion or navigating across files.
But there are plenty of important use cases that can be satisfied
on a purely syntactic level,
such as code formatting and syntax highlighting.

### Demystifying the AST

Abstract syntax trees can be difficult to understand in the abstract.
So let's generate one and see what it looks like.

Consider the following single-line Swift file,
which declares a function named `one()` that returns the value `1`:

```swift
func one() -> Int { return 1 }
```

Run the `swiftc` command on this file
passing the `-frontend -emit-syntax` arguments:

```terminal
$ xcrun swiftc -frontend -emit-syntax ./One.swift
```

The result is a chunk of JSON representing the AST.
Its structure becomes much clearer once you reformat the JSON:

```json
{
    "kind": "SourceFile",
    "layout": [{
        "kind": "CodeBlockItemList",
        "layout": [{
            "kind": "CodeBlockItem",
            "layout": [{
                "kind": "FunctionDecl",
                "layout": [null, null, {
                    "tokenKind": {
                        "kind": "kw_func"
                    },
                    "leadingTrivia": [],
                    "trailingTrivia": [{
                        "kind": "Space",
                        "value": 1
                    }],
                    "presence": "Present"
                }, {
                    "tokenKind": {
                        "kind": "identifier",
                        "text": "one"
                    },
                    "leadingTrivia": [],
                    "trailingTrivia": [],
                    "presence": "Present"
                }, ...
```

{% info %}
The Python `json.tool` module offers a convenient way to format JSON.
It comes standard in macOS releases going back as far as anyone can recall.
For example, here's how you could use it with the redirected compiler output:

```terminal
$ xcrun swiftc -frontend -emit-syntax ./One.swift | python -m json.tool
```

{% endinfo %}

At the top-level, we have a `SourceFile`
consisting of `CodeBlockItemList` elements
and their constituent `CodeBlockItem` parts.
This example has a single `CodeBlockItem`
for the function declaration (`FunctionDecl`),
which itself comprises subcomponents including
a function signature,
parameter clause,
and return clause.

The term <dfn>trivia</dfn>
is used to describe anything that isn't syntactically meaningful,
like whitespace.
Each token can have one or more pieces of leading and trailing trivia.
For example, the space after the `Int` in the return clause (`-> Int`)
is represented by the following piece of trailing trivia.

```json
{
  "kind": "Space",
  "value": 1
}
```

### Working Around File System Constraints

SwiftSyntax generates abstract syntax trees
by delegating system calls to `swiftc`.
However, this requires code to be associated with a file
in order to be processed,
and it's often useful to work with code as a string.

One way to work around this constraint
is to write code to a temporary file
and pass that to the compiler.

[We've written about temporary files in the past](https://nshipster.com/nstemporarydirectory/),
but nowadays, there's a much nicer API for working with them
that's provided by the
[Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) itself.
In your `Package.swift` file, add the following package dependency,
and add the `"Utility"` dependency to the appropriate target:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager.git", from: "0.3.0"),
```

Now, you can import the `Basic` module
and use its `TemporaryFile` API like so:

```swift
import Basic
import Foundation

let code: String

let tempfile = try TemporaryFile(deleteOnClose: true)
defer { tempfile.fileHandle.closeFile() }
tempfile.fileHandle.write(code.data(using: .utf8)!)

let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: tempfile.path.asString)
let sourceFile = try SyntaxTreeParser.parse(url)
```

## What Can You Do With It?

Now that we have a reasonable idea of how SwiftSyntax works,
let's talk about some of the ways that you can use it!

### Writing Swift Code: The Hard Way

The first and _least_ compelling use case for SwiftSyntax
is to make writing Swift code an order of magnitude more difficult.

SwiftSyntax, by way of its `SyntaxFactory` APIs,
allows you to generate entirely new Swift code from scratch.
Unfortunately, doing this programmatically
isn't exactly a walk in the park.

For example,
consider the following code:

```swift
import SwiftSyntax

let structKeyword = SyntaxFactory.makeStructKeyword(trailingTrivia: .spaces(1))

let identifier = SyntaxFactory.makeIdentifier("Example", trailingTrivia: .spaces(1))

let leftBrace = SyntaxFactory.makeLeftBraceToken()
let rightBrace = SyntaxFactory.makeRightBraceToken(leadingTrivia: .newlines(1))
let members = MemberDeclBlockSyntax { builder in
    builder.useLeftBrace(leftBrace)
    builder.useRightBrace(rightBrace)
}

let structureDeclaration = StructDeclSyntax { builder in
    builder.useStructKeyword(structKeyword)
    builder.useIdentifier(identifier)
    builder.useMembers(members)
}

print(structureDeclaration)
```

_Whew._
So what did all of that effort get us?

```swift
struct Example {
}
```

_Oofa doofa._

This certainly isn't going to replace
[GYB](https://nshipster.com/swift-gyb/) for everyday code generation purposes.
(In fact,
[libSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/Syntax/SyntaxKind.cpp.gyb)
and
[SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/blob/master/Sources/SwiftSyntax/SyntaxKind.swift.gyb)
both make extensive use of `gyb` to generate its interfaces.)

But this interface can be quite useful when precision matters.
For instance,
you might use SwiftSyntax to implement a
[fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)
for the Swift compiler,
using it to randomly generate arbitrarily-complex-but-ostensibly-valid
programs to stress test its internals.

## Rewriting Swift Code

[The example provided in the SwiftSyntax README](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax#example)
shows how to write a program to take each integer literal in a source file
and increment its value by one.

Looking at that,
you can already extrapolate out to how this might be used
to create a canonical `swift-format` tool.
But for the moment,
let's consider a considerably _less_ productive ---
and more seasonally appropriate (🎃) ---
use of source rewriting:

```swift
import SwiftSyntax

public class ZalgoRewriter: SyntaxRewriter {
    public override func visit(_ token: TokenSyntax) -> Syntax {
        guard case let .stringLiteral(text) = token.tokenKind else {
            return token
        }

        return token.withKind(.stringLiteral(zalgo(text)))
    }
}
```

What's that
[`zalgo`](https://gist.github.com/mattt/b46ab5027f1ee6ab1a45583a41240033)
function all about?
You're probably better off not knowing...

Anyway, running this rewriter on your source code
transforms all string literals in the following manner:

```swift
// Before 👋😄
print("Hello, world!")

// After 🦑😵
print("H͞͏̟̂ͩel̵ͬ͆͜ĺ͎̪̣͠ơ̡̼͓̋͝, w͎̽̇ͪ͢ǒ̩͔̲̕͝r̷̡̠͓̉͂l̘̳̆ͯ̊d!")
```

_Spooky, right?_

## Highlighting Swift Code

Let's conclude our look at SwiftSyntax
with something that's actually useful:
a Swift syntax highlighter.

A <dfn>syntax highlighter</dfn>, in this sense,
describes any tool that takes source code
and formats it in a way that's more suitable for display in HTML.

[NSHipster is built on top of Jekyll](https://github.com/NSHipster/nshipster.com),
and uses the Ruby library [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge)
to colorize the example code you see in every article.
However, due to Swift's relatively complex syntax
and rapid evolution,
the generated HTML isn't always 100% correct.

Instead of [messing with a pile of regular expressions](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/blob/master/lib/rouge/lexers/swift.rb),
we could instead
[build a syntax highlighter](https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter)
that leverages SwiftSyntax's superior understanding of the language.

At its core,
the implementation is rather straightforward:
implement a subclass of `SyntaxRewriter`
and override the `visit(_:)` method
that's called for each token as a source file is traversed.
By switching over each of the different kinds of tokens,
you can map them to the HTML markup for their
[corresponding highlighter tokens](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/List-of-tokens).

For example,
numeric literals are represented with `<span>` elements
whose class name begins with the letter `m`
(`mf` for floating-point, `mi` for integer, etc.).
Here's the corresponding code in our `SyntaxRewriter` subclass:

```swift
import SwiftSyntax

class SwiftSyntaxHighlighter: SyntaxRewriter {
    var html: String = ""

    override func visit(_ token: TokenSyntax) -> Syntax {
        switch token.tokenKind {
        <#...#>
        case .floatingLiteral(let string):
            html += "<span class=\"mf\">\(string)</span>"
        case .integerLiteral(let string):
            if string.hasPrefix("0b") {
                html += "<span class=\"mb\">\(string)</span>"
            } else if string.hasPrefix("0o") {
                html += "<span class=\"mo\">\(string)</span>"
            } else if string.hasPrefix("0x") {
                html += "<span class=\"mh\">\(string)</span>"
            } else {
                html += "<span class=\"mi\">\(string)</span>"
            }
        <#...#>
        default:
            break
        }

        return token
    }
}
```

Although `SyntaxRewriter` has specialized `visit(_:)` methods
for each of the different kinds of syntax elements,
I found it easier to handle everything in a single `switch` statement.
(Printing unhandled tokens in the `default` branch
was a really helpful way to find any cases that I wasn't already handling).
It's not the most elegant of implementations,
but it was a convenient place to start
given my limited understanding of the library.

Anyway, after a few hours of development,
I was able to generate reasonable colorized output
for a wide range of Swift syntactic features:
