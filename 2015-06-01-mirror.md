Reflection in Swift is a limited affair,
providing read-only access to information about objects.
In fact, this functionality might be better described as
<dfn>introspection</dfn> rather than reflection.

But can you really blame them for going with that terminology?

"Introspection" is such a bloviated and acoustically unpleasant word
compared to "Reflection."
And how could anyone pass on the nominal slam dunk of
calling the type responsible for reflecting an object's value a `Mirror`?
What equivalent analogy can we impart for the act of introspection?
`struct LongDarkTeaTimeOfTheSoul`?
(As if we didn't have better things to do than
ask our Swift code about the meaning of `Self`)

Without further ado,
let's take a peek inside the inner workings of how Swift exposes
that of our own code:
`Mirror`, `CustomReflectable`, and `CustomLeafReflectable`.

---

Swift provides a default <dfn>reflection</dfn>, or structured view,
for every object.
This view is used by [Playgrounds](/xcplayground/)
([unless a custom description is provided](/customplaygrounddisplayconvertible/)),
and also acts as a fallback when describing objects
that don't conform to the
`CustomStringConvertible` or `CustomDebugStringConvertible` protocols.

You can customize how instances of a type are reflected
by adopting the `CustomReflectable` protocol
and implementing the required `customMirror` property.

The computed `customMirror` property returns a `Mirror` object,
which is typically constructed by reflecting `self` and
passing the properties you wish to expose to the reflected interface.
Properties may be either
keyed and passed in a dictionary
or unkeyed and passed in an array.
You can optionally specify a display style
to override the default for the kind of type (`struct`, `class`, `tuple`, etc.);
if the type is a class,
you also have the ability to adjust how ancestors are represented.

## Conforming to CustomReflectable

To get a better understanding of how this looks in practice,
let's look at an example involving an implementation of a data model
for the game of chess:

A chessboard comprises 64 squares,
divided into
8 rows (called <dfn>ranks</dfn>) and
8 columns (called <dfn>files</dfn>).
A compact way to represent each location on a board
is the [0x88 method](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_representation_(chess)#0x88_method>),
in which the rank and file are encoded into 3 bits of each
[nibble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble)
of a byte (`0b0rrr0fff`).

_For simplicity, `Rank` and `File` are typealias'd to `UInt8`
and use one-based indices;
a more complete implementation might use enumerations instead._

```swift
struct ChessBoard {
    typealias Rank = UInt8
    typealias File = UInt8

    struct Coordinate: Equatable, Hashable {
        private let value: UInt8

        var rank: Rank {
            return (value >> 3) + 1
        }

        var file: File {
            return (value & 0b00000111) + 1
        }

        init(rank: Rank, file: File) {
            precondition(1...8 ~= rank && 1...8 ~= file)
            self.value = ((rank - 1) << 3) + (file - 1)
        }
    }
}
```

If we were to construct a coordinate for b8 (rank 8, file "b" or 2),
its default reflection wouldn't be particularly helpful:

```swift
let b8 = ChessBoard.Coordinate(rank: 8, file: 2)
String(reflecting: b8) // ChessBoard.Coordinate(value: 57)
```

`57` in decimal is equal to `0111001` in binary,
or a value of 7 for rank and 1 for file,
which adding the index offset of 1 brings us to
rank 8 and file 2.

The default mirror provided for a structure
includes each of an object's stored properties.
However, consumers of this API shouldn't need to know
or even care about the implementation details of how this information is stored.
It's more important to reflect the programmatic surface area of the type,
and we can use `CustomReflectable` to do just that:

```swift
extension ChessBoard.Coordinate: CustomReflectable {
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["rank": rank, "file": file])
    }
}
```

Rather than exposing the private stored `value` property,
our custom mirror provides the computed `rank` and `file` properties.
The result: a much more useful representation
that reflects our understanding of the type:

```swift
String(reflecting: b8) // ChessBoard.Coordinate(rank: 8, file: 2)
```

### Introspecting the Custom Mirror

The `String(reflecting:)` initializer is one way that mirrors are used.
But you can also get at them directly through the `customMirror` property
to access the type metatype and display style,
and enumerate each of the mirror's children.

```swift
b8.customMirror.subjectType // ChessBoard.Coordinate.Type
b8.customMirror.displayStyle // struct

for child in b8.customMirror.children {
    print("\(child.label ?? ""): \(child.value)")
}
```

### Customizing the Display of a Custom Mirror

There are differently-shaped mirrors for each kind of Swift value,
each with their own particular characteristics.

For example,
the most important information about a class is its identity,
so its reflection contains only its fully-qualified type name.
Whereas a structure is all about substance
and offers up its type name and values.

If you find this to be less than flattering for your special type
you can change up your look by specifying an enumeration value
to the `displayStyle` attribute in the `Mirror` initializer.

Here's a sample of what you can expect
for each of the available display styles
when providing both labeled and unlabeled children:

#### Labeled Children

```swift
extension ChessBoard.Coordinate: CustomReflectable {
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["rank": rank, "file": file])
                      displayStyle: <#displayStyle#>)
    }
}
```

| Style        | Output                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `class`      | `ChessBoard.Coordinate`        |
| `struct`     | `Coordinate(rank: 8, file: 2)` |
| `enum`       | `Coordinate(8)`                |
| `optional`   | `8`                            |
| `tuple`      | `(rank: 8, file: 2)`           |
| `collection` | `[8, 2]`                       |
| `set`        | `{8, 2}`                       |
| `dictionary` | `[rank: 8, file: 2]`           |

#### Unlabeled Children

```swift
extension ChessBoard.Coordinate: CustomReflectable {
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      unlabeledChildren: [rank, file],
                      displayStyle: <#displayStyle#>)
    }
}
```

| Style        | Output                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `class`      | `ChessBoard.Coordinate` |
| `struct`     | `Coordinate()`          |
| `enum`       | `Coordinate(8)`         |
| `optional`   | `8`                     |
| `tuple`      | `(8, 2)`                |
| `collection` | `[8, 2]`                |
| `set`        | `{8, 2}`                |
| `dictionary` | `[ 8, 2]`               |

{% warning %}
You can't change how tuples are reflected.
As described in our article about [`Void`](/void/),
tuples aren't <dfn>nominal types</dfn>,
so you can't write extensions to add conformance to `CustomReflectable`
{% endwarning %}

## Reflection and Class Hierarchies

Continuing with our chess example,
let's introduce some class by defining an abstract `Piece` class
and subclasses for pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings.
(For flavor, let's add [standard valuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value)
while we're at it).

```swift
class Piece {
    enum Color: String {
        case black, white
    }

    let color: Color
    let location: ChessBoard.Coordinate?

    init(color: Color, location: ChessBoard.Coordinate? = nil) {
        self.color = color
        self.location = location
        precondition(type(of: self) != Piece.self, "Piece is abstract")
    }
}

class Pawn:   Piece { static let value = 1 }
class Knight: Piece { static let value = 3 }
class Bishop: Piece { static let value = 3 }
class Rook:   Piece { static let value = 5 }
class Queen:  Piece { static let value = 9 }
class King:   Piece {}
```

So far, so good.
Now let's use the same approach as before to define a custom mirror
(setting the `displayStyle` to `struct`
so that we get more reflected information than we would otherwise for a class):

```swift
extension Piece: CustomReflectable {
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["color": color,
                                 "location": location ?? "N/A"],
                      displayStyle: .struct))
    }
}
```

Let's see what happens if we try to reflect a new `Knight` object:

```swift
let knight = Knight(color: .black, location: b8)
String(reflecting: knight) //
Piece(color: black, location: (rank: 8, file: 2))
```

Hmm... that's no good.
What if we try to override that in an extension to `Knight`?

```swift
extension Knight {
    override var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["color": color,
                                 "location": location ?? "N/A"])
    }
} // ! error: overriding declarations in extensions is not supported
```

_No dice_ (to mix metaphors).

Let's look at three different options to get this working with classes.

### Option 1: Conform to CustomLeafReflectable

Swift actually provides something for just such a situation ---
a protocol that inherits from `CustomReflectable`
called `CustomLeafReflectable`.

If a class conforms to `CustomLeafReflectable`,
its reflections of subclasses will be suppressed
unless they explicitly override `customMirror` and provide their own `Mirror`.

Let's take another pass at our example from before,
this time adopting `CustomLeafReflectable` in our initial declaration:

```swift
class Piece: CustomLeafReflectable {
    // ...

    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(reflecting: self)
    }
}

class Knight: Piece {
    // ...

    override var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["color": color,
                                 "location": location ?? "N/A",
                                 "value": Knight.value],
                      displayStyle: .struct)
    }
}
```

Now when go to reflect our knight,
we get the correct type --- `Knight` instead of `Piece`.

```swift
String(reflecting: knight)
// Knight(color:Piece.Color.black, location: (rank: 8, file: 2), value: 3)
```

Unfortunately, this approach requires us to do the same
for each of the subclasses.
Before we suck it up and copy-paste our way to victory,
let's consider our alternatives.

{% info %}

Types that wrap a single value like a string or number
can improve their reflected representation
simply by conforming to the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol.

For example,
the nested `Color` type can be unambiguously understood
by its raw value alone:

```swift
extension Piece.Color: CustomStringConvertible {
    var description: String {
        return self.rawValue
    }
}
```

With this in place,
the raw string values will be used
anytime `Piece.Color` is reflected
or shows up as a child in a mirror representation.

```swift
String(reflecting: Piece.Color.black) // black

String(reflecting: knight)
// Knight(color: black, location: (rank: 8, file: 2), value: 3)
```

{% endinfo %}

### Option 2: Encode Type in Superclass Mirror

A simpler alternative to going the `CustomLeafReflectable` route
is to include the type information as a child of the mirror
declared in the base class.

```swift
extension Piece: CustomReflectable {
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["type": type(of: self),
                                 "color": color,
                                 "location": location ?? "N/A"],
                      displayStyle: .struct)
    }
}

String(reflecting: knight)
// Piece(type: Knight, color: black, location: (rank: 8, file: 2))
```

This approach is appealing
because it allows reflection to be hidden as an implementation detail.
However, it can only work if subclasses are differentiated by behavior.
If a subclass adds stored members
or significantly differs in other ways,
it'll need a specialized representation.

Which begs the question:
_why are we using classes in the first place?_

### Option 3: Avoid Classes Altogether

Truth be told,
we only really introduced classes here
as a contrived example of how to use `CustomLeafReflectable`.
And what we came up with is kind of a mess, right?
Ad hoc additions of `value` type members for only some of the pieces
(kings don't have a value in chess because they're a win condition)?
An "abstract" base class that crashes if you try to instantiate it
(for [current lack of a first-class language feature](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0026-abstract-classes-and-methods.md))?
Yikes.
These are the kinds of things that give OOP a bad name.

We can mitigate nearly all of these problems
by adopting a protocol-oriented approach like the following:

First, define a protocol for `Piece`
and a new protocol to encapsulate pieces that have value, called `Valuable`:

```swift
protocol Piece {
    var color: Color { get }
    var location: ChessBoard.Coordinate? { get }
}

protocol Valuable: Piece {
    static var value: Int { get }
}
```

Next, define value types ---
an enum for `Color` and structures for each piece:

```swift
enum Color: String {
    case black, white
}

// ...

struct Knight: Piece, Valuable {
    static let value: Int = 3
    let color: Color
    let location: ChessBoard.Coordinate?
}

// ...
```

Although we can't provide conformance by protocol through an extension,
we can provide a default implementation for the requirements
and declare adoption in extensions to each concrete `Piece` type.
As a bonus, `Valuable` can provide a specialized variant
that includes its `value`:

```swift
extension Piece {
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["color": color,
                                 "location": location ?? "N/A"],
                      displayStyle: .struct)
    }
}

extension Valuable{
    var customMirror: Mirror {
        return Mirror(self,
                      children: ["color": color,
                                 "location": location ?? "N/A",
                                 "value": Self.value],
                      displayStyle: .struct)
    }
}

// ...
extension Knight: CustomReflectable {}
//...
```

Putting that all together,
we get exactly the behavior we want
with the advantage of value semantics.

```swift
let b8 = ChessBoard.Coordinate(rank: 8, file: 2)
let knight = Knight(color: .black, location: b8)

String(reflecting: knight)
// Knight(color: black, location: (rank: 8, file: 2))
```

Ultimately,
`CustomLeafReflectable` is provided mostly for compatibility with
the classical, hierarchical types in Objective-C frameworks like UIKit.
If you're writing new code, you need not follow in their footsteps.

---

When Swift first came out,
longtime Objective-C developers missed the dynamism provided by that runtime.
And --- truth be told ---
truth be told, things weren't all super great.
Programming in Swift could, at times,
feel unnecessarily finicky and constraining.
_"If only we could [swizzle](https://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/)…"_
we'd grumble.

And perhaps this is still the case for some of us some of the time,
but with Swift 4,
many of the most frustrating use cases have been solved.

Codable is a better solution to JSON serialization
than was ever available using dynamic introspection.
Codable can also provide mechanisms for fuzzing and fixtures
to sufficiently enterprising and clever developers.
The `CaseIterable` protocol fills another hole,
allowing us a first-class mechanism
for getting an inventory of enumeration cases.
In many ways,
Swift has leap-frogged the promise of dynamic programming,
making APIs like `Mirror` largely unnecessary beyond logging and debugging.

That said,
should you find the need for introspection,
you'll know just where to look.
