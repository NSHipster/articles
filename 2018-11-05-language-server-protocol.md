In October 2018,
Apple [announced on the Swift.org forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/new-lsp-language-service-supporting-swift-and-c-family-languages-for-any-editor-and-platform/17024)
that it was starting work to adopt
the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
(<abbr title="Language Server Protocol">LSP</abbr>)
for Swift and C languages.

**This is arguably the most important decision Apple has made for Swift
since releasing the language as open source in 2014.**
It's a big deal for app developers,
and it's an even bigger deal for Swift developers on other platforms.

To understand why,
this week's article will take a look at
what problem the Language Server Protocol solves,
how it works,
and what its long-term impacts may be.

**Update**:
GitHub recently announced
[Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces/),
an upcoming feature that promises
_"the full Visual Studio Code experience without leaving GitHub"_.
Thanks to Swift's support for LSP,
we'll soon be able to edit Swift code —
syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and all —
directly from the browser.

Why wait for the
[rumored](https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1252187152831692800)
announcement of Xcode for iPad at [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/)?

Imagine a grid
with each row representing a different programming language
(Swift, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, etc.)
and each column representing a different code editor
(Xcode, Visual Studio, Vim, Atom, etc.),
such that each cell represents
the level of support that a particular editor has for a language.

{% asset lsp-languages-times-editors.svg  %}

Up until recently,
what you'd find was a patchwork of compatibility
across the various combinations.
Some editors offered deep integration with a few languages
and little to no support for anything else,
whereas other editors aimed to be general-purpose
with at least a modicum of support for many languages.
(The term <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>
is often used to describe the former.)

Case in point:
_You'd be stubborn not to use Xcode for app development
and foolish to use it for anything else._

For an editor to have better support for a particular language,
it needs to write integration code ---
either directly in the code base or via a plugin system.
Due to implementation differences across languages and editors,
improvements to, say,
Ruby support in Vim
wouldn't translate into better support for Python,
nor could they be applied to make Ruby work better in Atom.
The end result: inconsistent support across technologies
and a lot of wasted effort.

The situation we described
is often referred to as an <dfn>M × N problem</dfn>,
where the number of integrations is the _product_ of
`M` editors and `N` languages.
What the Language Server Protocol does is change this M × N problem
into a <dfn>M + N problem</dfn>.

Rather than an editor having to implement support for each language,
it only needs to support the LSP.
And in doing so, it gets the same level of functionality
for all languages that support the LSP.

An essay from 2010 by Tomohiro Matsuyama
entitled ["Emacs は死んだ" (_"Emacs is Dead"_)](https://tkf.github.io/2013/06/04/Emacs-is-dead.html)
offers a nice encapsulation of this problem.
Describing the limitations of Emacs' scripting language
(no multi-threading, few low-level APIs, and a small user base)
Matsuyama argues that the preferred approach to writing a plugin
should be to interface with an external program
rather than implement something natively.
{% endinfo %}

Language Server Protocol provides a common set of functionality
for supported languages, including:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Automatic Formatting
- Autocomplete
- Syntax
- Tooltips
- Inline Diagnostics
- Jump to Definition
- Find References in Project
- Advanced Text and Symbol Search

Rather than reinventing the wheel for each new technology,
tools and editors can invest in better usability
and more advanced functionality.

## How Language Server Protocol Works

If you're an iOS developer,
you may be most familiar with
the terms <dfn>server</dfn> and <dfn>protocol</dfn>
in the sense of communicating with web applications
in JSON format via HTTP.
This actually isn't too far off from how the Language Server Protocol works.

In the case of LSP,
the _client_ refers to the editor ---
or more generally, the tool ---
and the _server_ refers to
an external program run locally in a separate process.

As for the _protocol_ itself,
LSP resembles a simplified version of HTTP:

- Each message consists of
  a header part and a content part.
- The header part has a required `Content-Length` field
  containing the size of the content part in bytes,
  and an optional `Content-Type` field
  (`application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8` by default)
- The content part uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
  to describe the structure of requests, responses, and notifications.

Whenever something happens in the tool,
such as the user jumping to the definition of a symbol,
the tool sends a request to the server.
The server receives that request
and then returns an appropriate response.

For example,
imagine that a user opens the following Swift code
in an Xcode-like editor that supported the Language Server Protocol:

```swift
class Parent {}
class Child: Parent {}
```

When the user <kbd>⌘</kbd>-clicks the symbol `Parent`
in the inheritance clause on line 2,
the editor jumps to the definition of the `Parent` class on line 1.

{% asset lsp-jump-to-definition.gif  %}

Here's how LSP enables this interaction behind the scenes:

First,
when the user opens the Swift code,
the editor launches its Swift language server in a separate process,
if it isn't running already,
and performs any additional setup.

When the user executes the "jump to definition" command,
the editor sends the following request to its Swift language server:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "textDocument/definition",
  "params": {
    "textDocument": {
      "uri": "file:///Users/NSHipster/Example.swift"
    },
    "position": {
      "line": 1,
      "character": 13
    }
  }
}
```

Upon receiving this request,
the Swift language server uses a compiler tool like
[SourceKit](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/tools/SourceKit)
to identify the corresponding code entity
and find the location of its declaration on the preceding line.
The language server then responds with the following message:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "uri": "file:///Users/NSHipster/Example.swift",
    "range": {
      "start": {
        "line": 0,
        "character": 6
      },
      "end": {
        "line": 0,
        "character": 12
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Finally,
the editor navigates to the file
(which, in this case, is already open),
moves the cursor to that range,
and highlights the token.

The beauty of this approach is that the editor did all of this
without knowing anything about the Swift programming language
other than that `.swift` files are associated with Swift code.
All the editor needs to do
is talk to the language server and update the UI.
And knowing how to do that,
the editor can follow the same procedure
to facilitate this interaction
for code written in any language with a language server implementation.

## Language Server Protocol Support in Clang / LLVM

If the _M + N_ diagram from before looks familiar,
it might be because it's the same approach taken by LLVM.

At the core of LLVM is an intermediate representation (IR).
Supported languages generate IR using a <dfn>compiler frontend</dfn>,
and that IR can generate machine code
for any platform supported by a <dfn>compiler backend</dfn>.

{% asset lsp-llvm-ir.svg %}

{% endinfo %}

The LLVM compiler frontend for C languages
is called [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org).
It's also used by Swift for inter-operability with Objective-C.
In its recent 5.0.0 release,
Clang added a new tool called
[Clangd](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html),
LLVM's implementation for the Language Server Protocol.

In April 2018,
[Apple announced to the LLVM mailing list](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2018-April/057668.html)
that it was switching the focus of its development efforts from
[libclang](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html)
to Clangd as the primary way to create interactive tooling.

Now you might think, _"So what?"_
Apple is among the most prominent supporters of the LLVM project ---
having, among other things,
employed the project's founder, Chris Lattner, for over a decade.
Apple's decision to switch from one obscure Clang tool to another
would seem to be an implementation detail (so to speak).

What makes this announcement quite interesting
is that Clangd appears to have been created entirely outside of Apple,
with significant contributions from Google and other companies.
This announcement signals a significant shift
in the direction of tooling development going forward ---
something that would be confirmed 6 months later on the Swift.org forums.

## Getting Started with Language Server Protocol

Xcode 11.4 includes `sourcekit-lsp` in its default toolchain.
You can use the `xcrun` command
to get the path to the language server executable:

```terminal
$ xcrun -f sourcekit-lsp
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/sourcekit-lsp
```

Check out [our article about Visual Studio Code](/vscode/)
to get started with our go-to editors.
Beyond that,
the sourcekit-lsp project on GitHub has
[instructions for integrating with Sublime Text, Vim, Emacs, and others.](https://github.com/NSHipster/sourcekit-lsp/tree/master/Editors#editor-integration).

## Potential Consequences of Apple's Support of Language Server Protocol

It'll take some time to feel the full impact of these developments,
but believe me: your patience will be rewarded.
Here are just a few of what I believe will happen as a result of LSP
in the coming months and years.

### Swift Becomes More Appealing as a General-Purpose Programming Language

Although Swift is used primarily for app development,
it was designed from the start to be
a capable general-purpose programming language.
Between
[Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/),
[SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio),
and other projects,
we're just starting to see the promise of
what Swift can do beyond the App Store.

Among the biggest factors holding Swift back from
mainstream adoption up to this point
has been its reliance on Xcode.

It's a lot to ask, say, a web developer or machine learning engineer
to download Xcode just to try Swift
when there are so many great alternatives
with a much lower barrier to entry.
Support for the Language Server Protocol
should make it significantly easier for folks outside the Apple ecosystem
to evaluate Swift with the same, familiar tools they use for everything else.

### Xcode Gets Better

Adopting LSP isn't just about making Swift work better in other editors;
Xcode stands to benefit immensely, as well.

Consider [this forum post](https://forums.swift.org/t/new-lsp-language-service-supporting-swift-and-c-family-languages-for-any-editor-and-platform/17024/29)
from Project Lead for Swift at Apple, Ted Kremenek:

> will be functionally more powerful than SourceKit is today.

LSP is an opportunity for the Xcode team to take a fresh approach to
Swift integration,
and to capitalize on all of the improvements to the language and tooling
in the four years since its 1.0 release.

Our first glimpse into this overhauled infrastructure comes by way of
[IndexStoreDB](https://github.com/apple/indexstore-db):
a powerful new API for querying code symbols in Swift projects
from a [Clang index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cH2sTpgSnJZCkZtJl1aY-rzy4uGPcrI-6RrUpdATO2Q/).

### Xcode (Eventually) Becomes More Capable

The benefit of LSP isn't limited to Swift and Objective-C;
[from another post by Argyrios in that thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/new-lsp-language-service-supporting-swift-and-c-family-languages-for-any-editor-and-platform/17024/33):

> Getting Xcode to use our new LSP service

> and it’s something that we are interested in,
> but we don’t have specific plans to announce at this moment.

The main focus for the current efforts are to improve the story for Swift.
But once that's done, it should be relatively straightforward
to have those benefits cascade down to other languages with LSP support.

* * *

The architecture of software
reflects the structure and values of the organizations that create it.
The converse is true as well, to some extent.

By adopting the open Language Server Protocol standard for Xcode,
Apple is making good on its commitment to the success of Swift
on platforms outside the Apple ecosystem.
And I think it'll work:
tooling (or lack thereof) is often the key decider
in which technologies gain mindshare.
But perhaps more importantly,
I believe this decision demonstrates an increased willingness within
(at least some small part of) the company
for collaboration and transparency.
