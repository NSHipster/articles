Swift is a fast, safe, modern programming language
with an open governance model and a vibrant community.
There's no reason that it should be limited to _just_ making apps.
And indeed,
many smart people are working hard to
[bring Swift to new platforms](https://forums.swift.org/t/windows-nightlies/19174/1)
and evolve its capabilities for
[web development](https://swift.org/server/) and
[machine learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/).

Scripting is another point of interest for the Swift community,
but the amount of setup required to incorporate 3rd-party dependencies
has long been seen as a non-starter.

...that is, until now.

On Friday,
[Max Howell](https://twitter.com/mxcl/)
[announced](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/1083942251003297794)
a new project called
[swift-sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh).
The project provides a shim around the Swift compiler
that creates a package for your script
and uses it to automatically add and manage external dependencies
imported with a special trailing comment.

Although in its initial stages of development,
it's already seemingly managed to solve the biggest obstacle
to Swift from becoming a productive scripting language.

This week,
let's take a very early look at this promising new library
and learn how to start using it today to write Swift scripts.

## Installation and Setup

Assuming you have Swift and the Xcode Developer Tools on your system,
you can install `swift-sh` with [Homebrew](/homebrew/)
using the following command:

```terminal
$ brew install mxcl/made/swift-sh
```

{% info %}
The `swift` command line executable
is designed to be extensible through subcommands.
If you type an unknown subcommand like `swift foo`,
the system will look for a command called `swift-foo`.
This mechanism allows `swift-sh` to be run either directly
or as using the `swift sh` subcommand.
{% endinfo %}

## Example Usage

The original Swift Package Manager examples
provided a
[shuffleable](https://github.com/apple/example-package-fisheryates)
[`Deck`](https://github.com/apple/example-package-deckofplayingcards) of
[`PlayingCard`](https://github.com/apple/example-package-playingcard) values.
So it feels appropriate to revisit them here.

For this example,
let's build a Swift script to deal and print out a formatted representation of
a hand of [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge).
The final result should look something like this:

<table style="width:500px; line-height:1; margin:1em;" cellpadding="5">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td style="width:33%;" colspan="2" rowspan="4"></td>
            <td style="width:3%; font-size:120%">♠</td>
            <td style="width:30%;">10 9 8 7</td>
            <td style="width:33%;" colspan="2" rowspan="4"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="color:#FF0000; width:3%; font-size:120%">♥</td>
            <td style="width:30%;">6 5 4 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="color:#FF0000; width:3%; font-size:120%">♦</td>

{% endinfo %}

### Importing Dependencies

Start by creating a new `.swift` file
with a <dfn>shebang</dfn> at the beginning _(more on that later)_.

```terminal
$ echo "#!/usr/bin/env swift sh" > bridge.swift
```

Next,
add import declarations for three modules:
`DeckOfPlayingCards`, `PlayingCard`, and `Cycle`.

```swift
import DeckOfPlayingCards // @NSHipster ~> 4.0.0
import PlayingCard
import Cycle // @NSHipster == bb11e28
```

The comment after the import declaration for `DeckOfPlayingCards`
tells `swift-sh` to look for the package
on GitHub in a repository by the same name
under the [`NSHipster`](https://github.com/NSHipster) username.
The tilde-greater-than operator in `~> 4.0.0`
is shorthand for specifying a version
"equal to or greater than in the least significant digit"
according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) conventions.
In this case, Swift Package Manager will use the latest release
whose major is equal to `4 and minor release is equal`0`(that is, it will use`4.0.1`or`4.0.0`, but not`4.1.0`or`5.0.0`).

For the `PlayingCard` module,
we don't have to add an import specification for
because it's already included as a dependency of `DeckOfPlayingCards`.

Finally,
the `Cycle` module is an external package
and includes an external import specification
that tells `swift-sh` how to add it as a dependency.
The notable difference here is that
the `==` operator is used to specify a revision
rather than a tagged release.

### Enlisting Players

With all of our dependencies accounted for,
we have everything we need to write our script.

First,
create a `Player` class, consisting of `name` and `hand` properties.

```swift
class Player {
    var name: String
    var hand: [PlayingCard] = []

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

In an extension, conform `Player` to `CustomStringConvertible`
and implement the `description` property,
taking advantage of the convenient
[`Dictionary(grouping:by:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary/2995342-init)
initializer
[added to Swift 4](https://swift.org/blog/dictionary-and-set-improvements/).
By convention,
a player's hand is grouped by suit and ordered by rank.

```swift
extension Player: CustomStringConvertible {
    var description: String {
        var description = "\(name):"

        let cardsBySuit = Dictionary(grouping: hand) { $0.suit }
        for (suit, cards) in cardsBySuit.sorted(by: { $0.0 > $1.0 }) {
            description += "\t\(suit) "
            description += cards.sorted(by: >)
                                .map{ "\($0.rank)" }
                                .joined(separator: " ")
            description += "\n"
        }

        return description
    }
}
```

### Shuffling and Dealing the Deck

Create and shuffle a standard deck of 52 playing cards,
and initialize players at each of the four cardinal directions.

```swift
var deck = Deck.standard52CardDeck()
deck.shuffle()

var north = Player(name: "North")
var west = Player(name: "West")
var east = Player(name: "East")
var south = Player(name: "South")
```

In Bridge,
cards are dealt one-by-one to each player
until no cards remain.
We use the `cycled()` method
to rotate between each of our players
to ensure an even and fair deal.

```swift
let players = [north, east, west, south]
var round = players.cycled()

while let card = deck.deal(),
    let player = round.next()
{
    player.hand.append(card)
}
```

After the cards are dealt,
each player has 13 cards.

```swift
for player in players {
    print(player)
}
```

### Running the Card Game

We can run our completed Swift script
from the command line by passing the file
as an argument to the `swift sh` subcommand.

```terminal
$ swift sh ./bridge.swift
North:	♠︎ K 10 9 8 5 4
	♡ K 3
	♢ A 10
	♣︎ A 4 2

West:	♠︎ J 3 2
	♡ 9 6 5
	♢ Q 9 8 3 2
	♣︎ 6 5

East:	♠︎ Q 7
	♡ A J 10 7 4
	♢ K 5 4
	♣︎ 10 7 3

South:	♠︎ A 6
	♡ Q 8 2
	♢ J 7 6
	♣︎ K Q J 9 8
```

_Smashing!_

### Making an Executable

On Unix systems,
a <dfn>shebang</dfn> (`#!`) indicates how a script should be interpreted.
In our case, the shebang line at the top of `bridge.swift`
tells the system to run the file using
the `sh` subcommand
of the `swift` command provided by the current environment
(`/usr/bin/env`):

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env swift sh
```

Doing so allows you to take the extra step
to make a Swift script look and act just like a binary executable.
Use `mv` to strip the `.swift` extension
and `chmod` to add executable (`+x`) permissions.

```terminal
$ mv bridge.swift bridge
$ chmod +x bridge
$ ./bridge
```

{% warning %}
Using `#!/usr/bin/env swift sh` instead of `#!/usr/bin/swift sh`
invokes the `swift` found in your environment `$PATH`
rather than a hard-coded path.
This is especially important to keep in mind
if you have multiple versions of Swift installed,
such as through a language manager like
[swiftenv](https://github.com/kylef/swiftenv).
{% endwarning %}

## Current Limitations

As a very early release,
it's expected for there to be a few rough edges and missing features.
Here are some important details to keep in mind
as you're getting started with `swift-sh`:

### Dependency on GitHub

Imported dependencies can correspond to only GitHub repositories.
There's currently no way to specify other remote or local locations.
We expect this to be added in a future release.

```swift
// 🔮 Possible Future Syntax
import Remote // git://example.com/Remote.git
import Local // ~/path/to/Local.git
```

### Module Names Must Match Repository Names

`swift-sh` requires module names to match the name of their repository.
In many cases, this isn't a problem
because projects typically have descriptive names.
However, in our example,
the `DeckOfPlayingCards` module
was provided by the repository
[apple/example-package-deckofplayingcards](https://github.com/apple/example-package-deckofplayingcards).

You might expect the following syntax to be supported,
but this doesn't work yet:

```swift
// 🔮 Possible Future Syntax
import DeckOfPlayingCards // @apple/example-package-deckofplayingcards
```

Until such an affordance is provided,
the easiest workaround is to fork the existing repository
and rename your fork
(as we did with [@NSHipster/DeckOfPlayingCards](https://github.com/NSHipster/DeckOfPlayingCards)).

{% info %}
For what it's worth,
we would have used a fork regardless
since the `PlayingCard` type in the latest mainline release
inconveniently declares `suit` and `rank` properties with `internal` access.
{% endinfo %}

### Lack of Support for Import Declaration Syntax

As described in [last week's article](/import/),
Swift provides special syntax for
importing individual declarations from external modules.

In our example,
we import the [Cycle](https://github.com/NSHipster/Cycle) package
to access its `cycle()` function,
which is used to iterate over the players during the initial deal repeatedly.

In a conventional Swift package setup,
we could import that function only.
However, that syntax isn't yet supported by `swift-sh`.

```swift
// 🔮 Possible Future Syntax
import func Cycle.cycle() // @NSHipster/Cycle
```

Until full support for import declaration syntax is added,
you'll only be able to import external modules in their entirety.

---

Given the importance of this functionality,
we think `swift-sh` is destined to become part of the language.
As momentum and excitement build around this project,
keep an eye out in the [Swift forums](https://forums.swift.org)
for proposals to incorporate this as a language feature
in a future release.
