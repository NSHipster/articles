It's not enough to make software;
you also have to make it easy to install.

Apple's had this figured out for almost a decade.
Anyone can go to the App Store and --- with a single tap ---
start using any one of a million apps in just a few moments.

Compare that to the all-too-common scenario
when you go to install any other random piece of software:

> Download this gzip'd tarball of source code ---
> oh, and all of its dependencies, too.
> And make sure you have the latest version of Xcode
> (but if you're running latest beta, use the development branch instead).
> You might hit this one bug, but don't worry:
> there's a workaround posted on StackOverflow...
> _wait, where are you going?_

Of course, we know there's a better way.

For iOS and macOS frameworks,
we use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
or [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods).
For Swift packages,
we use [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).
And when it comes time to distribute
a command-line tool built in Swift,
we use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Homebrew is the _de facto_ system package manager for macOS.
It's the best way to install and manage programs that run on the command-line
(and with [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask),
it's the best way to install apps, too).

Simply put:
**If you want your software to reach the largest audience of developers on macOS,
write and publish a Homebrew formula for it.**

Even if you're a long-time user of Homebrew,
you may find the prospect of contributing to it daunting.
But fear not --- the process is straightforward and
[well-documented](https://docs.brew.sh).
For relatively simple projects,
newcomers can expect to have a working formula finished within an hour;
projects with a complex build process or dependency graph
may take a while longer,
but Homebrew is flexible enough to handle anything you throw at it.

For our article about the [SwiftSyntax](/swiftsyntax/) library,
we wrote a [syntax highlighter for Swift code](https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter).
We'll be using that project again for this article
as an example for how to write and publish a Homebrew formula.
(If you'd like to follow along at home,
make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/#install) installed
and can run the `brew` command from the Terminal)

{% info %}

Homebrew is a <dfn>system package manager</dfn>
that installs and manages versions of software on the system.

Contrast that with a <dfn>language package manager</dfn>
like the Swift Package Manager,
which is responsible for resolving dependencies and
compiling code into modules or programs.
(Though this distinction can get fuzzy
when language package managers _(\*cough\* RubyGems \*cough\* npm)_
install binaries globally)

For what it's worth,
we think it's best to leave each to their respective tasks.

{% endinfo %}

## Creating a Makefile

Although we _could_ write out all of our build instructions directly to Homebrew,
a better approach would be to delegate that process
to proper build automation system.

There are lots of build automation tools out there ---
notably [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build) and
[Buck](https://buckbuild.com),
which have both gained traction within the iOS community recently.
For this example, though,
we're going to use [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29).

Now, we could dedicate an entire <del>article</del> <ins>book</ins> to Make.
But here's a quick intro:

Make is a <dfn>declarative</dfn> build automation tool,
meaning that it can infer everything that needs to happen
when you ask it to build something.
Build instructions are declared in a file named `Makefile`,
which contains one or more <dfn>rules</dfn>.
Each rule has a <dfn>target</dfn>,
the target's <dfn>dependencies</dfn>,
and the <dfn>commands</dfn> to run.

Here's a
[simplified](https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter/blob/master/Makefile)
version of the `Makefile` used to build
the `swift-syntax-highlight` command-line executable:

```makefile
prefix ?= /usr/local
bindir = $(prefix)/bin
libdir = $(prefix)/lib

build:
	swift build -c release --disable-sandbox

install: build
	install -d "$(bindir)" "$(libdir)"
	install ".build/release/swift-syntax-highlight" "$(bindir)"
	install ".build/release/libSwiftSyntax.dylib" "$(libdir)"
	install_name_tool -change \
		".build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/release/libSwiftSyntax.dylib" \
		"$(libdir)/libSwiftSyntax.dylib" \
		"$(bindir)/swift-syntax-highlight"

uninstall:
	rm -rf "$(bindir)/swift-syntax-highlight"
	rm -rf "$(libdir)/libSwiftSyntax.dylib"

clean:
	rm -rf .build

.PHONY: build install uninstall clean
```

This `Makefile` declares four targets:
`build`, `install`, `uninstall`, and `clean`.

`build` calls `swift build` with `release` configuration
and the option to disable
[App Sandboxing](https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/)
(which otherwise causes problems when installing via Homebrew).

`install` depends on `build` ---
which makes sense because
you can't install something that hasn't been built yet.
The `install` command copies the executable to `/usr/local/bin`,
but because `swift-syntax-highlighter` links to `libSwiftSyntax.dylib`,
we need to install that to `/usr/local/lib`
and use the `install_name_tool` command
to modify the executable and update its path to the
[dynamic library](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/UsingDynamicLibraries.html).
If your project only links to system dynamic libraries
(like `@rpath/libswiftCore.dylib`)
then you won't have to do any of this.

The `uninstall` and `clean` targets are the inverse to `install` and `build`,
and are particularly useful when you're writing or debugging your `Makefile`.

Before proceeding to the next step,
you should be able to do the following with your `Makefile`:

- **Perform a clean install.**
  If you have any build failures,
  address those first and foremost.
- **Run the program after cleaning.**
  Cleaning the project after installation
  reveals any linker errors.
- **Uninstall successfully.**
  After running `make uninstall`,
  your executable should no longer be accessible from your `$PATH`.

## Writing a Homebrew Formula

A Homebrew <dfn>formula</dfn> is a Ruby file that contains
instructions for installing a library or executable on your system.

Run the `brew create` subcommand to generate a formula,
passing a URL to your project.
Homebrew will automatically fill in a few details,
including the formula name and Git repository.

```terminal
$ brew create https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter
```

After filling in the metadata fields and
specifying installation and test instructions,
here's what the formula for `swift-syntax-highlight` looks like:

```ruby
class SwiftSyntaxHighlight < Formula
  desc "Syntax highlighter for Swift code"
  homepage "https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter"
  url "https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter.git",
      tag: "0.1.0", revision: "6c3e2dca81965f902694cff83d361986ad86f443"
  head "https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter.git"

  depends_on xcode: ["10.0", :build]

  def install
    system "make", "install", "prefix=#{prefix}"
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/swift-syntax-highlight" "import Foundation\n"
  end
end
```

{% info %}

If your Swift project or one of its dependencies is a
[system module package](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/PackageDescriptionV4.md#providers),
your formula should include that system module as a dependency.
In which case,
the installation steps in your formula may differ from
how someone would install the software manually.

For `swift-syntax-highlight`,
we could have created a separate formula for `libSwiftSyntax`,
listed that as a dependency,
and linked to the Homebrew version
rather than package it together with the binary.

{% endinfo %}

## Testing a Homebrew Formula Locally

Once you've put the finishing touches on your formula,
it's a good idea to give it a quick taste test
before you share it with the rest of the world.

You can do that by running `brew install`
and passing the `--build-from-source` option
with a path to your formula.
Homebrew will run through the entire process
as if it were just fetched from the internet.

```terminal
$ brew install --build-from-source Formula/swift-syntax-highlight.rb
==> Cloning https://github.com/NSHipster/SwiftSyntaxHighlighter.git
Updating ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/swift-syntax-highlight--git
==> Checking out tag 0.1.0
HEAD is now at 6c3e2dc
==> make install prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/swift-syntax-highlight/0.1.0
```

Assuming that works as expected,
go ahead and `brew uninstall` and get ready to publish.

## Publishing a Tap

In [Homebrew parlance](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#homebrew-terminology),
a <dfn>tap</dfn> is a collection of formulae
contained within a Git repository.
Creating a tap is as simple as creating a directory,
copying your formula from the previous step,
and setting up your repo:

```terminal
$ mkdir -p homebrew-formulae/Formula
$ cd homebrew-formulae
$ cp path/to/formula.rb Formula/
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Installing a Formula from a Tap

By convention,
taps named `"homebrew-formulae"` and published on GitHub
are accessible from the command line at `<# organization #>/formulae`.
You can either add the tap to Homebrew's search list
or install a formula by fully-qualified name:

```terminal
# Option 1:
$ brew tap nshipster/formulae
$ brew install swift-syntax-highlight

# Option 2:
$ brew install nshipster/formulae/swift-syntax-highlight
```

With your formula installed,
you can now run any of its packaged executables from the command-line:

```terminal
$ swift-syntax-highlight 'print("Hello, world!")'
<pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre>
```

_Neat!_

Now looking at all of this,
you might think that this is a lot of work ---
and you'd be right, to some extent.
It's not nothing.

You might say,

> I'm doing this for free, and I don't owe nothing to nobody.
> Read the [license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT):
> This software is provided _"as-is"_.
> If you don't like that,
> go ahead and fork it yourself.

If you do, that's fine.
You're completely entitled to feel this way,
and we sincerely appreciate your contributions.

But please consider this:
if you spend, say, an hour making it easier to install your software,
that's at least that much saved for everyone else who wants to use it.
For a popular piece of software,
that can literally add up to _years_ of time
spent doing something more important.

You've already put so much effort into your work,
why not share it with someone else who will appreciate it. üçª
