Nothingness has been a regular topic of discussion on NSHipster,
from [our first article about `nil` in Objective-C](/nil/)
to [our recent look at the `Never` type in Swift](/never/).
But today's article is perhaps the most fraught with
[_horror vacui_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_vacui)
of them all,
as we gaze now into the `Void` of Swift.

---

What is `Void`?
In Swift, it's nothing but an empty tuple.

```swift
typealias Void = ()
```

We become aware of the `Void` as we fill it.

```swift
let void: Void = ()
void. // No Completions
```

`Void` values have no members:
no methods, no values, not even a name.
It's a something more nothing than `nil`.
For an empty vessel,
Xcode gives us nothing more than empty advice.

## Something for Nothing

Perhaps the most prominent and curious use of the `Void` type
in the standard library is found in the `ExpressibleByNilLiteral` protocol.

```swift
protocol ExpressibleByNilLiteral {
    init(nilLiteral: ())
}
```

Types conforming to `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`
can be initialized with the `nil` literal.
Most types don't adopt this protocol,
as it makes more sense to represent the absence of a specified value
using an `Optional` for that type.
But you may encounter it occasionally.

The required initializer for `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`
shouldn't take any real argument.
(If it did, what would that even be?)
However, the requirement can't just be an empty initializer `init()` ---
that's already used as the default initializer for many types.

You could try to work around this
by changing the requirement to
a type method that returned a `nil` instance,
but some mandatory internal state may be inaccessible outside of an initializer.
But a better solution ---
and the one used here ---
is to add a `nilLiteral` label by way of a `Void` argument.
It's an ingenious use of existing functionality
to achieve unconventional results.

## No Things Being Equal

Tuples, along with
metatypes (like `Int.Type`, the result of calling `Int.self`),
function types (like `(String) -> Bool`)
and existentials (like `Encodable & Decodable`),
comprise <dfn>non-nominal</dfn> types.
In contrast to the <dfn>nominal</dfn>, or named, types
that comprise most of Swift,
non-nominal types are defined in relation to other types.

Non-nominal types cannot be extended.
`Void` is an empty tuple,
and because tuples are non-nominal types,
you can't add methods or properties
or conformance to protocols.

```swift
extension Void {} // Non-nominal type 'Void' cannot be extended
```

`Void` doesn't conform to `Equatable` --- it simply can't.
Yet when we invoke the "is equal to" operator (`==`),
it works as expected.

```swift
void == void // true
```

We reconcile this apparent contradiction with a global free-function,
declared outside of any formal protocol.

```swift
func == (lhs: (), rhs: ()) -> Bool {
    return true
}
```

This same treatment is given to the "is less than" operator (`<`),
which acts as a stand-in for the `Comparable` protocol
and its derived comparison operators.

```swift
func < (lhs: (), rhs: ()) -> Bool {
    return false
}
```

{% info %}
The Swift standard library provides implementations of the comparison functions
for tuples with <dfn>arity</dfn>, or size, up to 6.
This is, however, considered a hack.
At various times,
the Swift core team has expressed interest in
adding formal `Equatable` conformance for tuples,
but at the time of writing, no formal proposals are being discussed.
{% endinfo %}

## Ghost in the Shell

`Void`, as a non-nominal type, can't be extended.
However, `Void` is still a type,
and can, therefore, be used as a generic constraint.

For example,
consider this generic container for a single value:

```swift
struct Wrapper<Value> {
    let value: Value
}
```

We can first take advantage of
[conditional conformance](https://swift.org/blog/conditional-conformance/),
arguably _the_ killer feature in Swift 4.1,
to extend `Wrapper` to adopt `Equatable`
when it wraps a value that is itself `Equatable`.

```swift
extension Wrapper: Equatable where Value: Equatable {
    static func ==(lhs: Wrapper<Value>, rhs: Wrapper<Value>) -> Bool {
        return lhs.value == rhs.value
    }
}
```

Using the same trick from before,
we can approximate `Equatable` behavior
by implementing a top-level `==` function
that takes `Wrapper<Void>` arguments.

```swift
func ==(lhs: Wrapper<Void>, rhs: Wrapper<Void>) -> Bool {
    return true
}
```

In doing so,
we can now successfully compare two constructed wrappers around `Void` values.

```swift
Wrapper(value: void) == Wrapper(value: void) // true
```

However, if we attempt to assign such a wrapped value to a variable,
the compiler generates a mysterious error.

```swift
let wrapperOfVoid = Wrapper<Void>(value: void)
// üëª error: Couldn't apply expression side effects :
// Couldn't dematerialize wrapperOfVoid: corresponding symbol wasn't found
```

The horror of the `Void` becomes once again its own inverted retort.

## The Phantom Type

Even when you dare not speak its non-nominal name,
there is no escaping `Void`.

Any function declaration with no explicit return value
implicitly returns `Void`

```swift
func doSomething() { ... }

// Is equivalent to

func doSomething() -> Void { ... }
```

This behavior is curious,
but not particularly useful,
and the compiler will generate a warning
if you attempt to assign a variable to
the result of a function that returns `Void`.

```swift
doSomething() // no warning

let result = doSomething()
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Constant 'result' inferred to have type 'Void', which may be unexpected
```

You can silence this warning
by explicitly specifying the `Void` type.

```swift
let result: Void = doSomething() // ()
```

{% info %}
By contrast,
functions that return non-`Void` values
generate warnings if you don't assign their return value.

For more details,
see [SE-0047 "Defaulting non-Void functions so they warn on unused results"](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0047-nonvoid-warn.md).
{% endinfo %}

## Trying to Return from the Void

If you squint at `Void?` long enough,
you might start to mistake it for `Bool`.
These types are <dfn>isometric</dfn>,
both having exactly two states:
`true` / `.some(())` and `false` / `.none`.

But isometry doesn't imply equivalence.
The most glaring difference between the two
is that `Bool` is `ExpressibleByBooleanLiteral`,
whereas `Void` isn't --- and can't be,
for the same reasons that it's not `Equatable`.
So you can't do this:

```swift
(true as Void?) // error
```

{% warning %}
`Void` may be the spookiest type in Swift,
but `Bool` gives it a run for its money
when typealias'd to `Booooooool` üëª.
{% endwarning %}

But hard-pressed,
`Void?` can act in the same way as `Bool`.
Consider the following function that randomly throws an error:

```swift
struct Failure: Error {}

func failsRandomly() throws {
    if Bool.random() {
        throw Failure()
    }
}
```

The correct way to use this method
is to call it within a `do / catch` block
using a `try` expression.

```swift
do {
    try failsRandomly()
    // executes on success
} catch {
    // executes on failure
}
```

The incorrect-but-ostensibly-valid way to do this
would be to exploit the fact that `failsRandomly()`
implicitly returns `Void`.
The `try?` expression transforms the result of a statement that throws
into an optional value,
which in the case of `failsRandomly()`, results in `Void?`.
If `Void?` has `.some` value (that is, `!= nil`),
that means the method returned without throwing an error.
If `success` is `nil`,
then we know that the method produced an error.

```swift
let success: Void? = try? failsRandomly()
if success != nil {
    // executes on success
} else {
    // executes on failure
}
```

As much as you may dislike the ceremony of `do / catch` blocks,
you have to admit that they're a lot prettier than what's happening here.

It's a stretch,
but this approach might be valid in very particular and peculiar situations.
For example,
you might use a static property on a class
to lazily produce some kind of side effect exactly once
using a self-evaluating closure:

```swift
static var oneTimeSideEffect: Void? = {
   return try? data.write(to: fileURL)
}()
```

Even still,
an `Error` or `Bool` value would probably be more appropriate.

## Things that go _"Clang"_ in the Night

If,
while reading this chilling account you start to shiver,
you can channel the necrotic energy of the `Void` type
to conjure immense amounts of heat to warm your spirits.

...which is to say,
the following code causes `lldb-rpc-server` to max out your CPU:

```swift
extension Optional: ExpressibleByBooleanLiteral where Wrapped == Void {
    public typealias BooleanLiteralType = Bool

    public init(booleanLiteral value: Bool) {
        if value {
            self.init(())!
        } else {
            self.init(nilLiteral: ())!
        }
    }
}

let pseudoBool: Void? = true // we never get to find out
```

Keeping in the Lovecraft-ian tradition,
`Void` has a physical form that the computer is incapable of processing;
simply witnessing it renders the process incurably insane.

## A Hollow Victory

Let's conclude our hallowed study of `Void`
with a familiar refrain.

```swift
enum Result<Value, Error> {
    case success(Value)
    case failure(Error)
}
```

If you recall
[our article about the `Never` type](/never),
a `Result` type
with its `Error` type set to `Never`
can be used to represent operations that always succeed.

In a similar way,
we might use `Void` as the `Value` type
to represent operations that,
when they succeed,
don't produce any meaningful result.

For example,
apps may implement tell-tale heartbeat
by regularly "pinging" a server with a simple network request.

```swift
func ping(_ url: URL, completion: (Result<Void, Error>) -> Void) {
    // ...
}
```

{% info %}
According to HTTP semantics,
the correct status code for a hypothetical `/ping` endpoint
would be [204 No Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204).
{% endinfo %}

In the completion handler of the request,
success would be indicated by the following call:

```swift
completion(.success(()))
```

Not enamored with effusive parentheticals (but why not?),
you could make thing a bit nicer
through a strategic extension on `Result`.

```swift
extension Result where Value == Void {
    static var success: Result {
        return .success(())
    }
}
```

Nothing lost; nothing gained.

```swift
completion(.success)
```

---

It may seem like a purely academic exercise ---
philosophical, even.
But an investigation into the `Void` yields deep insights
into the very fabric of reality for the Swift programming language.

In ancient times,
long before Swift had seen the light of day,
tuples played a fundamental role in the language.
They represented argument lists and
associated enumeration values,
fluidly moving between its different contexts.
At some point that model broke down.
And the language has yet to reconcile the incongruities
between these disparate constructs.

So according to Swift Mythos,
`Void` would be the paragon of the elder gods:
the true singleton,
blind nullary at the center of infinity
unaware of its role or influence;
the compiler unable to behold it.

But perhaps this is all just an invention
at the periphery of our understanding ---
a manifestation of our misgivings about the long-term viability of the language.
After all,
when you stare into the `Void`,
the `Void` stares back into you.
