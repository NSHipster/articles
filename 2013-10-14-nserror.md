All programs on a Unix system are a child process of another process, forking all the way from the original process, the unmoved mover: `pid` 1 (which in the case of OS X is `launchd`). When the executable finishes, it communicates a status code between `0` and `255` to its parent, as a way to communicate why or how the process exited. `0` means "everything exited normally; nothing to report here", while any non-zero value indicates something that the parent process should be aware of. Exit status codes may be used to indicate whether the process crashed, or terminated prematurely. By some conventions, the higher the return value, the more severe the cause of the error.

In an OO paradigm processes are, for the most part, abstracted away, leaving only objects and the messages they pass between one another. That distinction between success and failure (and between different varieties of failure) is still useful in object-oriented programming. But considering that methods are often wont to return values other than `BOOL`, this can create something of a predicament.

Languages more drama-prone and trigger-happy than Objective-C reconcile this by abusing the hell out of exceptions, raising at even the slightest breach in contract. To our good fortune as Cocoanauts, however, Objective-C takes a more civilized approach when it comes to giving us bad news, and that approach is `NSError`.

* * *

`NSError` is the unsung hero of the Foundation framework. Passed gallantly in and out of perilous method calls, it is the messenger by which we are able to contextualize our failures. No news is good news, when it comes to such matters, but passing a `nil` pointer to an `NSError **` isn't going to do you any favors.

`NSError` is toll-free bridged with `CFError`, but it's unlikely that you'll ever find a reason to dip down to its Core Foundation counterpart.

Each `NSError` object encodes three critical pieces of information: a status `code`, corresponding to a particular error `domain`, as well as additional context provided by a `userInfo` dictionary.

## `code` & `domain`

Like exit status codes, an `NSError -code` signals the nature of the problem. These status codes are defined within a particular error `domain`, in order to avoid overlap and confusion. These status codes are generally defined by constants in an `enum`.

For example, in the `NSCocoaErrorDomain`, the status code for an error caused by `NSFileManager` attempting to access a non-existant file is `4`, as defined by `NSFileNoSuchFileError`. However, `4` in `NSPOSIXErrorDomain` refers to a [POSIX `EINTR`, or "interupted function" error](http://250bpm.com/blog:12).

Now, anyone coming from a systems programming background may have just had a vision of a `switch` statement with smatterings of `printf` to translate numeric constants into something human-readable. `NSError` is way ahead of you.

## `userInfo`

What gives `NSError` its particular charm is everyone's favorite grab bag property: `userInfo`. As a convention throughout Cocoa, `userInfo` is a dictionary that contains arbitrary key-value pairs that, whether for reasons of subclassing or schematic sparsity, are not suited to full-fledged properties in and of themselves. In the case of `NSError`, there are several special keys that correspond to `readonly` properties.

Three are generally useful:

- `localizedDescription` (`NSLocalizedDescriptionKey`): A localized description of the error.
- `localizedRecoverySuggestion` (`NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestionErrorKey`): A localized recovery suggestion for the error.
- `localizedFailureReason` (`NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey`): A localized explanation of the reason for the error.

...whereas three others are specific to OS X:

- `localizedRecoveryOptions` (`NSLocalizedRecoveryOptionsErrorKey`): An array containing the localized titles of buttons appropriate for displaying in an alert panel
- `recoveryAttempter` (`NSRecoveryAttempterErrorKey`)
- `helpAnchor` (`NSHelpAnchorErrorKey`): Used by an alert panel by a help anchor button.

Here's how to construct `NSError` with a `userInfo` dictionary:

~~~{objective-c}
NSDictionary *userInfo = @{
  NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: NSLocalizedString(@"Operation was unsuccessful.", nil),
  NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey: NSLocalizedString(@"The operation timed out.", nil),
  NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestionErrorKey: NSLocalizedString(@"Have you tried turning it off and on again?", nil)
                          };
NSError *error = [NSError errorWithDomain:NSHipsterErrorDomain
                                     code:-57
                                 userInfo:userInfo];
~~~

The advantage of encapsulating this information in an object like `NSError`, as opposed to, say, throwing exceptions willy-nilly, is that these error objects can be easily passed between different objects and contexts.

For example, a controller that calls a method that populates an `NSError **` (as discussed in the next section) might pass that error into an alert view:

~~~{objective-c}
[[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:error.localizedDescription
                            message:error.localizedRecoverySuggestion
                           delegate:nil
                  cancelButtonTitle:NSLocalizedString(@"OK", nil)
                  otherButtonTitles:nil, nil] show];
~~~

> As a brief non-sequitur: one clever hack used by C functions to communicate errors is to [encode 4-letter ASCII sequences in the 32 bit return type](https://github.com/mattt/Xcode-Snippets/blob/master/checkerror.m). It's no `localizedDescription`, but it's better than cross-referencing error codes from a table every time!

For sake of completeness: here is a list of the standard `NSError` `userInfo` keys:

- `NSLocalizedDescriptionKey`
- `NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey`
- `NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestionErrorKey`
- `NSLocalizedRecoveryOptionsErrorKey`
- `NSFilePathErrorKey`
- `NSStringEncodingErrorKey`
- `NSUnderlyingErrorKey`
- `NSRecoveryAttempterErrorKey`
- `NSHelpAnchorErrorKey`

## Using `NSError`

There are two ways in which you will encounter `NSError`: as a consumer and as a producer.

### Consuming

As a consumer, you are primarily concerned with methods that have a final parameter of type `NSError **`. Again, this is to get around the single return value constraint of Objective-C; by passing a pointer to an uninitialized `NSError *` variable, that variable will be populated with any error the method encounters:

~~~{objective-c}
NSError *error = nil;
BOOL success = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] moveItemAtPath:@"/path/to/target"
                                                       toPath:@"/path/to/destination"
                                                        error:&error];
if (!success) {
    NSLog(@"%@", error);
}
~~~

> According to Cocoa conventions, methods returning `BOOL` to indicate success or failure are encouraged to have a final `NSError **` parameter if there are multiple failure conditions to distinguish between. A good guideline is whether you could imagine that `NSError` bubbling up, and being presented to the user.

Another way `NSError` objects are passed is the inclusion of an `NSError *` argument in `completionHandler` blocks. This gets around both a constraint on single value returns as well as one on that value being returned synchronously. This has become especially popular with newer Foundation APIs, like `NSURLSession`:

~~~{objective-c}
NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com"];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];
NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:[NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration]];
[[session dataTaskWithRequest:request
            completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    if (!data) {
        NSLog(@"%@", error);
    } else {
        // ...
    }
}] resume];
~~~

### Producing

One would be well-advised to follow the same conventions for error handling as other Foundation classes. In situations where a custom method invokes a method with an `NSError **` parameter, it is usually a good idea to similarly pass that `NSError **` parameter into the signature of the custom method. More substantial apps or libraries are encouraged to define their own error domains and error code constants as suitable.

To pass an error to an `NSError **` parameter, do the following:

~~~{objective-c}
- (BOOL)validateObject:(id)object
                 error:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)outError
{
    // call another API, passing &error into its (NSError **) parameter
    NSError *error = nil;
    BOOL success = ...; 

    if (!success) {
        if (outError) {
            *outError = [NSError errorWithDomain:NSHipsterErrorDomain
                                            code:-42
                                        userInfo:@{NSUnderlyingErrorKey: error}];
        }
    }

    return success;
}
~~~

The root error, if one exists, should be returned as part of your custom error's `userInfo` dictionary as the value for `NSUnderlyingErrorKey`.


## `NSURLErrorDomain` & `CFNetworkErrors`

The greatest source of failure in iOS apps is networking. Between radios, transport, data roaming policies, proxies, security, authentication, and any number of protocol-specific negotiation, there is a lot that can go wrong.

On the plus side, the Foundation URL Loading system is incredibly mature, and takes care of most of that for you. The only negative is that the documentation for all of the various things that can go wrong is scattered across different programming guides and headers. If you get a request failing with error `-1004`, it can be _surprisingly_ difficult to figure out exactly what that means.

As such, here is an exhaustive, well-formatted table at your disposal:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -1<br>`NSURLErrorUnknown` |  |
| 1<br>`kCFHostErrorHostNotFound` | <q>Indicates that the DNS lookup failed.</q> |
| 2<br>`kCFHostErrorUnknown` | <q>An unknown error occurred (a name server failure, for example). For additional information, query the kCFGetAddrInfoFailureKey to get the value returned from getaddrinfo; lookup in netdb.h</q> |
| 100<br>`kCFSOCKSErrorUnknownClientVersion` | <q>The SOCKS server rejected access because it does not support connections with the requested SOCKS version.Query kCFSOCKSStatusCodeKey to recover the status code returned by the server.</q> |
| 101<br>`kCFSOCKSErrorUnsupportedServerVersion` | <q>The version of SOCKS requested by the server is not supported. Query kCFSOCKSStatusCodeKey to recover the status code returned by the server.<br><br>Query the kCFSOCKSVersionKey to find the version requested by the server.</q> |

### SOCKS4 Errors

| 112<br>`kCFSOCKS4ErrorIdConflict` | <q>Request rejected because the client program and identd report different user-ids.</q> |
| 113<br>`kCFSOCKS4ErrorUnknownStatusCode` | <q>The status code returned by the server is unknown.</q> |

### SOCKS5 Errors

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|

Having scrolled down through that huge table, you might be expecting the usual NSHipster philosophical wrap-up. Not this week. Do you have any idea how long it took to compile that table? It's all, like, `NSRepetitiveStrainInjury` up in here.
