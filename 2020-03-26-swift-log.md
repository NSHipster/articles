In 2002,
the United States Congress enacted
the [Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley_Act),
which introduced broad oversight to corporations
in response to accounting scandals at companies like
[Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) and 
[MCI WorldCom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCI_Inc.#Accounting_scandals)
around that time.
This act,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_DSS">
<abbr title="Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard">PCI</abbr>
</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIPAA">
<abbr title="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act">
HIPAA
</abbr>
</a>,
formed the regulatory backdrop
for a new generation of
<abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr> companies
emerging from the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).

Around the same time,
we saw the emergence of ephemeral, distributed infrastructure ‚Äî
what we now call ["Cloud computing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) ‚Äî
a paradigm that made systems more capable but also more complex.

To solve both the regulatory and logistical challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century,
our field established best practices around application logging.
And many of the same tools and standards are still in use today.

<aside class="parenthetical">

Just as `print` is a poor man's [debugger](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/429/),
it's also a shallow replacement for a proper logging system,
with distinct log levels and configurable output settings.

_Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley_ is notable for giving rise to
_[Yates v. United States](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/13-7451)_:
a delightful Supreme Court case that asked the question
_"Are fish (üêü) tangible objects?"

Although the Court found in a 5 ‚Äì 4 decision
that fish are _not_, in fact, "tangible objects" 
(for purposes of the statute),
we remain unconvinced
for the same reasons articulated in
[Justice Kagan's dissent](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/574/528/#tab-opinion-3243031)
_(and pretty much anything written by
[Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon),
for that matter)_.

This week on NSHipster,
we're taking a look at
[`SwiftLog`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log):
a community-driven, open-source standard for logging in Swift.

Developed by the Swift on Server community
and endorsed by the
[SSWG (Swift Server Work Group)](https://swift.org/server/),
its benefit isn't limited to use on the server.
Indeed,
any Swift code intended to be run from the command line
would benefit from adopting `SwiftLog`.
Read on to learn how.

{% warning %}

`SwiftLog` is distinct from the
[Unified Logging System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging)
(`os_log`),
which is specific to Apple platforms.

Readers may already be familiar with `os_log` and its, _\*ahem\*_
[quirks](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/03/06/problems-with-os_log/)
_(a topic for a future article, perhaps)_.
But for the uninitiated,
all you need to know is that
`os_log` is for macOS and iOS apps and
`SwiftLog` is for everything else.

If you're interested in learning more about Unified Logging,
you can get a quick overview of 
by skimming the [`os_log` docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging);
for an in-depth look,
check out
["Unified Logging and Activity Tracing"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/721/)
from WWDC 2016
and
["Measuring Performance Using Logging"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/405/)
from WWDC 2018.

{% endwarning %}

* * *

As always,
an example would be helpful in guiding our discussion.
In the spirit of transparency and nostalgia,
let's imagine writing a Swift program
that audits the finances of a '00s Fortune 500 company.

```swift
import Foundation

struct Auditor {
    func watch(_ directory: URL) throws { <#...#> }
    func cleanup() { <#...#> }
}

do {
    let auditor = Auditor()

    defer { auditor.cleanup() }
    try auditor.watch(directory: URL(string: "ftp://<#...#>/reports")!,
                     extensions: ["xls", "ods", "qdf"]) // poll for changes
} catch {
    print("error: \(error)")
}
```

An `Auditor` type polls for changes to a directory
_(an FTP server, because remember: it's 2003)_.
Each time a file is added, removed, or changed,
its contents are audited for discrepancies.
If any financial oddities are encountered,
they're logged using the `print` function.
The same goes for issues connecting to the FTP,
or any other problems the program might encounter ‚Äî
everything's logged using `print`.

<aside class="parenthetical">

The implementation details aren't important;
only the interface is relevant to our discussion.

</aside>

Simple enough.
We can run it from the command line like so:

```terminal
$ swift run audit
starting up...
ERROR: unable to reconnect to FTP

# (try again after restarting PC under our desk)

$ swift run audit
+ connected to FTP server
! accounting discrepancy in balance sheet 
** Quicken database corruption! **
^C
shutting down...
```

Such a program might be technically compliant,
but it leaves a lot of room for improvement:

- For one,
  our output doesn't have any timestamps associated with it.
  There's no way to know whether a problem was detected an hour ago or last week.
- Another problem is that our output lacks any coherent structure.
  At a glance,
  there's no straightforward way to isolate program noise from real issues.
- Finally, ‚Äî
  _and this is mostly due to an under-specified example_ ‚Äî
  it's unclear how this output is handled.
  Where is this output going?
  How is it collected, aggregated, and analyzed?

* * *

The good news is that
all of these problems (and many others) can be solved
by adopting a formal logging infrastructure in your project.

## Adopting SwiftLog in Your Swift Program

Adding `SwiftLog` to an existing Swift package is a breeze.
You can incorporate it incrementally
without making any fundamental changes to your code
and have it working in a matter of minutes.

### Add swift-log as a Package Dependency

In your `Package.swift` manifest,
add `swift-log` as a package dependency and
add the `Logging` module to your target's list of dependencies.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.1

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Auditor2000",
    products: [
        .executable(name: "audit", targets: ["audit"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-log.git", from: "1.2.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "audit", dependencies: ["Logging"])
    ]
)
```

### Create a Shared, Global Logger

`Logger` provides two initializers,
the simpler of them taking a single `label` parameter:

```swift
let logger = Logger(label: "com.NSHipster.Auditor2000")
```

In [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) systems,
programs operate on three, predefined
[streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams):

| File Handle | Description | Name            | 
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 0           | `stdin`     | Standard Input  |
| 1           | `stdout`    | Standard Output |
| 2           | `stderr`    | Standard Error  |

By default,
`Logger` uses the built-in `StreamLogHandler` type
to write logged messages to standard output (`stdout`).
We can override this behavior to instead write to standard error (`stderr`)
by using the more complex initializer,
which takes a `factory` parameter:
a closure that takes a single `String` parameter (the label)
and returns an object conforming to `LogHandler`.

```swift
let logger = Logger(label: "com.NSHipster.Auditor2000",
                    factory: StreamLogHandler.standardError)
```

{% info %}

Alternatively,
you can set default logger globally
using the `LoggingSystem.bootstrap()` method.

```swift
LoggingSystem.bootstrap(StreamLogHandler.standardError)
let logger = Logger(label: "com.NSHipster.Auditor2000")
```

After doing this,
any subsequent `Logger` instances created
using the `Logger(label:)` initializer
will default to the specified handler.

{% endinfo %}

### Replacing Print Statements with Logging Statements

Declaring our `logger` as a top-level constant
lets us call it anywhere within our module.
Let's revisit our example and spruce it up with our new logger:

```swift
do {
    let auditor = Auditor()

    defer {
        logger.trace("Shutting down")
        auditor.cleanup()
    }

    logger.trace("Starting up")
    try auditor.watch(directory: URL(string: "ftp://<#...#>/reports")!,
                      extensions: ["xls", "ods", "qdf"]) // poll for changes
} catch {
    logger.critical("\(error)")
}
```

The `trace`, `debug`, and `critical` methods
log a message at their respective <dfn>log level</dfn>.
`SwiftLog` defines seven levels,
ranked in ascending order of severity from `trace` to `critical`:

{::nomarkdown}
<table id="log-levels">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Level</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr id="log-level-trace">
            <td><code>.trace</code></td>
            <td>Appropriate for messages that contain information only when debugging a program.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="log-level-debug">
            <td><code>.debug</code></td>
            <td>Appropriate for messages that contain information normally of use only when debugging a program.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="log-level-info">
            <td><code>.info</code></td>
            <td>Appropriate for informational messages.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="log-level-notice">
            <td><code>.notice</code></td>
            <td>Appropriate for conditions that are not error conditions, but that may require special handling.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="log-level-warning">
            <td><code>.warning</code></td>
            <td>Appropriate for messages that are not error conditions, but more severe than <code>.notice</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="log-level-error">
            <td><code>.error</code></td>
            <td>Appropriate for error conditions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr id="log-level-critical">
            <td><code>.critical</code></td>
            <td>Appropriate for critical error conditions that usually require immediate attention.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
{:/}

If we re-run our `audit` example with our new logging framework in place,
we can see the immediate benefit of clearly-labeled, distinct severity levels
in log lines:

```terminal
$ swift run audit
2020-03-26T09:40:10-0700 critical: Couldn't connect to ftp://<#...#>

# (try again after plugging in loose ethernet cord)

$ swift run audit
2020-03-26T10:21:22-0700 warning: Discrepancy in balance sheet
2020-03-26T10:21:22-0700 error: Quicken database corruption
^C
```

Beyond merely labeling messages,
_which ‚Äî don't get us wrong ‚Äî is sufficient benefit on its own_,
log levels provide a configurable level of disclosure.
Notice that the messages logged with the `trace` method 
don't appear in the example output.
That's because `Logger` defaults to showing only messages
logged as `info` level or higher.

You can configure that by setting the `Logger`'s `logLevel` property.

```swift
var logger = Logger(label: "com.NSHipster.Auditor2000")
logger.logLevel = .trace
```

After making this change,
the example output would instead look something like this:

```terminal
$ swift run audit
2020-03-25T09:40:00-0700 trace: Starting up
2020-03-26T09:40:10-0700 critical: Couldn't connect to ftp://<#...#>
2020-03-25T09:40:11-0700 trace: Shutting down

# (try again after plugging in loose ethernet cord)

$ swift run audit
2020-03-25T09:41:00-0700 trace: Starting up
2020-03-26T09:41:01-0700 debug: Connected to ftp://<#...#>/reports
2020-03-26T09:41:01-0700 debug: Watching file extensions ["xls", "ods", "qdf"]
2020-03-26T10:21:22-0700 warning: Discrepancy in balance sheet
2020-03-26T10:21:22-0700 error: Quicken database corruption
^C
2020-03-26T10:30:00-0700 trace: Shutting down
```

## Using Multiple Logging Handlers at Once

Thinking back to our objections in the original example,
the only remaining concern 
is what we actually _do_ with these logs.

According to [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/logs) principles:

> ## XI. Logs
>
> _[...]_
>
> **A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with 
> routing or storage of its output stream.** 
> It should not attempt to write to or manage logfiles. 
> Instead, each running process writes its event stream, unbuffered, to `stdout`.

Collecting, routing, indexing, and analyzing logs across a distributed system
often requires a constellation of open-source libraries and commercial products.
Fortunately,
most of these components traffic in a shared currency of
[syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) messages ‚Äî
and thanks to
[this package by Ian Partridge](https://github.com/ianpartridge/swift-log-syslog),
Swift can, as well.

That said,
few engineers have managed to retrieve this information
from the likes of [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com)
and lived to tell the tale.
For us mere mortals,
we might prefer
[this package by Will Lisac](https://github.com/wlisac/swift-log-slack),
which sends log messages to
[Slack](https://slack.com).

The good news is that we can use both at once,
without changing how messages are logged at the call site
by using another piece of the `Logging` module:
`MultiplexLogHandler`.

```swift
import struct Foundation.ProcessInfo
import Logging
import LoggingSyslog
import LoggingSlack

LoggingSystem.bootstrap { label in
    let webhookURL = URL(string:
        ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["SLACK_LOGGING_WEBHOOK_URL"]!
    )!
    var slackHandler = SlackLogHandler(label: label, webhookURL: webhookURL)
    slackHandler.logLevel = .critical

    let syslogHandler = SyslogLogHandler(label: label)

    return MultiplexLogHandler([
        syslogHandler,
        slackHandler
    ])
}

let logger = Logger(label: "com.NSHipster.Auditor2000")
```

<aside class="parenthetical">

Harkening to [another 12 Factor principle](https://12factor.net/config),
we pull the webhook URL from an environment variable rather than hard-coding it.

</aside>

With all of this in place,
our system will log everything in syslog format to standard out (`stdout`),
where it can be collected and analyzed by some other system.

* * *

But the real strength of this approach to logging
is that it can be extended to meet the specific needs of any environment.
Instead of writing syslog to `stdout` or Slack messages,
your system could send emails,
open SalesForce tickets,
or trigger a webhook to activate some 
<abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> device.

<aside class="parenthetical">

Granted, each of those examples would probably be better served
by a separate monitoring service that ingests a log stream 
and reacts to events according to a more elaborate set of rules.

</aside>

Here's how you can extend `SwiftLog` to fit your needs
by writing a custom log handler:

## Creating a Custom Log Handler

The `LogHandler` protocol specifies the requirements for types
that can be registered as message handlers by `Logger`: 

```swift
protocol LogHandler {
    subscript(metadataKey _: String) -> Logger.Metadata.Value? { get set }
    var metadata: Logger.Metadata { get set }

    var logLevel: Logger.Level { get set }

    func log(level: Logger.Level,
             message: Logger.Message,
             metadata: Logger.Metadata?,
             file: String, function: String, line: UInt)
}
```

In the process of writing this article,
I created [custom handler](https://github.com/NSHipster/swift-log-github-actions) 
that formats log messages for GitHub Actions
so that they're surfaced on GitHub's UI like so:

{% asset github-actions-ui.png %}

{% info %}

For more information, 
see
["Workflow commands for GitHub Actions."](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions)

{% endinfo %}

If you're interested in making your own logging handler,
you can learn a lot by just browsing 
[the code for this project](https://github.com/NSHipster/swift-log-github-actions).
But I did want to call out a few points of interest here:

### Conditional Boostrapping

When bootstrapping your logging system,
you can define some logic for how things are configured.
For logging formatters specific to a particular CI vendor,
for example, 
you might check the environment to see if you're running locally or on CI
and adjust accordingly.

```swift
import Logging
import LoggingGitHubActions
import struct Foundation.ProcessInfo

LoggingSystem.bootstrap { label in
    // Are we running in a GitHub Actions workflow?
    if ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["GITHUB_ACTIONS"] == "true" {
        return GitHubActionsLogHandler.standardOutput(label: label)
    } else {
        return StreamLogHandler.standardOutput(label: label)
    }
}
```

### Testing Custom Log Handlers

Testing turned out to be more of a challenge than originally anticipated.
I could be missing something obvious,
but there doesn't seem to be a way to create assertions about
text written to standard output.
So here's what I did instead:

First,
create an `internal` initializer that takes a `TextOutputStream` parameter,
and store it in a `private` property.

<aside class="parenthetical">

Swift symbols have `internal` access control by default;
the keyword is included here for clarity.

</aside>

```swift
public struct GitHubActionsLogHandler: LogHandler {
    private var outputStream: TextOutputStream

    internal init(outputStream: TextOutputStream) {
        self.outputStream = outputStream
    }

    <#...#>
}
```

Then, 
in the test target,
create a type that adopts `TextOutputStream`
and collects logged messages to a stored property
for later inspection.
By using a 
[`@testable import`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AccessControl.html#ID5) 
of the module declaring `GitHubActionsLogHandler`,
we can access that `internal` initializer from before,
and pass an instance of `MockTextOutputStream` to intercept logged messages.

```swift
import Logging
@testable import LoggingGitHubActions

final class MockTextOutputStream: TextOutputStream {
    public private(set) var lines: [String] = []

    public init(_ body: (Logger) -> Void) {
        let logger = Logger(label: #file) { label in
            GitHubActionsLogHandler(outputStream: self)
        }

        body(logger)
    }

    // MARK: - TextOutputStream

    func write(_ string: String) {
        lines.append(string)
    }
}
```

With these pieces in place,
we can finally test that our handler works as expected:

```swift
func testLogging() {
    var logLevel: Logger.Level?
    let expectation = MockTextOutputStream { logger in
        logLevel = logger.handler.logLevel

        logger.trace("ü•±")
        logger.error("üò±")
    }

    XCTAssertGreaterThan(logLevel!, .trace)
    XCTAssertEqual(expectation.lines.count, 1) // trace log is ignored
    XCTAssertTrue(expectation.lines[0].hasPrefix("::error "))
    XCTAssertTrue(expectation.lines[0].hasSuffix("::üò±"))
}
```

{% warning %}

As to how or where messages are logged,
`SwiftLog` is surprisingly tight-lipped.
There's [an internal type](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/0e21dd789300fc37a43019fba68b4e97c9938142/Sources/Logging/Logging.swift#L524-L550) that buffers writes to `stdout`,
but it's not exposed by the module.

If you're in search for a replacement
and would prefer not to copy-paste something as involved as that,
here's a dead-simple alternative:

```swift
struct StandardTextOutputStream: TextOutputStream {
    mutating func write(_ string: String) {
        print(string)
    }
}
```

{% endwarning %}
