Working on a large iOS codebase often involves a lot of waiting:
Waiting for Xcode to index your files,
waiting for Swift and Objective-C code to compile,
waiting for the Simulator to boot and your app to launch...

And after all of that,
you spend even more time getting your app
into a particular state and onto a particular screen,
just to see whether the Auto Layout constraint you just added
fixes that regression you found.
It didn't, of course,
so you jump back into Xcode,
tweak the Content Hugging Priority,
hit <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>R</kbd>,
and start the whole process again.

We might relate our sorry predicament to
[that one xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/303/),
but for those of us who don't so much relish in
the stop-and-go nature of app development,
there's an old Yiddish joke about Shlemiel the painter
_(provided below with a few -specific modifications;
for the uninitiated,
please refer to Joel Spolsky's
[original telling](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/11/back-to-basics/))_:

> Shlemiel gets a job as a software developer,
> implementing a new iOS app.
> On the first sprint he opens Xcode
> and implements 10 new screens of the app.
> _"That’s pretty good!"_ says his manager,
> _"you’re a fast worker!"_ and pays him a Bitcoin.
>
> The next sprint Shlemiel only gets 5 screens done.
> _"Well, that’s not nearly as good as yesterday,
> but you’re still a fast worker. 5 screens is respectable,"_
> and pays him a Bitcoin.
>
> The next sprint Shlemiel implements 1 screen.
> _"Only 1!"_ shouts his manager.
> _"That’s unacceptable!
> On the first day you did ten times that much work!
> What’s going on?"_
>
> _"I can’t help it,"_ says Shlemiel.
> <em>"Each sprint I get further and further away from
> `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`!"</em>

Over the years,
there have been some developments that've helped things slightly,
including
[`@IBInspectable` and `@IBDesignable`](/ibinspectable-ibdesignable/)
and [Xcode Playgrounds](/xcplayground/).
But with Xcode 11,
our wait is finally over ---
and it's all thanks to SwiftUI.

{% warning %}

The functionality described in this article requires the following:

- **Xcode 11**
- **macOS Catalina**
- **iOS 13** set as the **Deployment Target** for your app's **Debug** configuration \\
  _(In Xcode, navigate your project's Build Settings;
  under the Deployment heading,
  expand the iOS Deployment Target setting and set Debug to iOS 13.0 or later)_

Without these three things,
your code either won't compile or won't render live previews.

{% endwarning %}

---

Although many of us have taken a [_"wait and see"_ approach](/wwdc-2019/) to SwiftUI,
we can start using its capabilities **today**
to radically speed up and improve our development process ---
_without changing a line of code in our UIKit apps_.

Consider a subclass of `UIButton`
that draws a border around itself:

```swift
final class BorderedButton: UIButton {
    var cornerRadius: CGFloat { <#...#> }
    var borderWidth: CGFloat { <#...#> }
    var borderColor: UIColor? { <#...#> }
}
```

Normally,
if we wanted to test how our UI element performs,
we'd have to add it to a view in our app,
build and run,
and navigate to that screen.
But with Xcode 11,
we can now see a preview side-by-side with the code editor
by adding the following under the original declaration of `BorderedButton`:

<div class="code-with-automatic-preview">

```swift
#if canImport(SwiftUI) && DEBUG
import SwiftUI

@available(iOS 13.0, *)
struct BorderedButton_Preview: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    UIViewPreview {
      let button = BorderedButton(frame: .zero)
      button.setTitle("Follow", for: .normal)
      button.tintColor = .systemOrange
      button.setTitleColor(.systemOrange, for: .normal)
      return button
    }.previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)
     .padding(10)
  }
}
#endif
```

</aside>

</div>

Using a new feature called <dfn>dynamic replacement</dfn>,
Xcode can update this preview without recompiling ---
within moments of your making a code change.
This lets you rapidly prototype changes like never before.

Want to see how your button handles long titles?
Bang away on your keyboard within the call to `setTitle(_:for:)`
in your preview,
and test out potential fixes in your underlying implementation
without so much as leaving your current file!

{% info %}

`UIViewPreview` is a custom, generic structure
that we created to conveniently host previews of `UIView` subclasses.
Feel free to [download the source](https://gist.github.com/mattt/ff6b58af8576c798485b449269d43607)
and add it to your project directly.

Incorporating a proper dependency would be complicated by
the conditional import and iOS 13 Deployment Target settings
required to make Xcode Previews work for non-SwiftUI apps,
so in this particular instance,
we think it's best to embed these files directly.

```swift
import UIKit

#if canImport(SwiftUI) && DEBUG
import SwiftUI
struct UIViewPreview<View: UIView>: UIViewRepresentable {
    let view: View

    init(_ builder: @escaping () -> View) {
        view = builder()
    }

    // MARK: - UIViewRepresentable

    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIView {
        return view
    }

    func updateUIView(_ view: UIView, context: Context) {
        view.setContentHuggingPriority(.defaultHigh, for: .horizontal)
        view.setContentHuggingPriority(.defaultHigh, for: .vertical)
    }
}
#endif
```

## Previewing Multiple States

Let's say our app had a `FavoriteButton` ---
a distant cousin (perhaps by composition) to `BorderedButton`.
In its default state,
it shows has the title "Favorite"
and displays a <span title="Heart">♡</span> icon.
When its `isFavorited` property is set to `true`,
the title is set to "Unfavorite"
and displays a <span title="Heart with slash">♡̸</span> icon.

We can preview both at once
by wrapping two `UIViewPreview` instances within a single SwiftUI `Group`:

<div class="code-with-automatic-preview">

```swift
Group {
  UIViewPreview {
    let button = FavoriteButton(frame: .zero)
    return button
  }
  UIViewPreview {
    let button = FavoriteButton(frame: .zero)
    button.isFavorited = true
    return button
  }
}.previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)
 .padding(10)
```

<aside>
{% asset swiftui-preview-favorite-unfavorite.png alt="SwiftUI previews with Favorite and Unfavorite buttons" %}
</aside>

</div>

{% info %}

The chained `previewLayout` and `padding` methods
apply to each member of the `Group`.
You can use these and
[other `View` methods](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view)
to change the appearance of your previews.

{% endinfo %}

## Previewing Dark Mode

With [Dark Mode in iOS 13](/dark-mode/),
it's always a good idea to double-check that your custom views
are configured with dynamic colors
or accommodate both light and dark appearance in some other way.

An easy way to do this
would be to use a `ForEach` element
to render a preview for each case in the `ColorScheme` enumeration:

<div class="code-with-automatic-preview">

```swift
ForEach(ColorScheme.allCases, id: \.self) { colorScheme in
    UIViewPreview {
      let button = BorderedButton(frame: .zero)
      button.setTitle("Subscribe", for: .normal)
      button.setImage(UIImage(systemName: "plus"), for: .normal)
      button.setTitleColor(.systemOrange, for: .normal)
      button.tintColor = .systemOrange
      return button
  }.environment(\.colorScheme, colorScheme)
   .previewDisplayName("\(colorScheme)")
}.previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)
 .background(Color(.systemBackground))
 .padding(10)
```

<aside>
{% asset swiftui-preview-color-schemes.png alt="SwiftUI previews with different color schemes" %}
</aside>

</div>

{% info %}

When rendering previews with `ForEach`,
use the `previewDisplayName` method to help distinguish among
all of the enumerated values.

{% endinfo %}

## Previewing Dynamic Type Size Categories

We can use the same approach to preview our views in various
[Dynamic Type Sizes](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/):

<div class="code-with-automatic-preview">

```swift
ForEach(ContentSizeCategory.allCases, id: \.self) { sizeCategory in
  UIViewPreview {
      let button = BorderedButton(frame: .zero)
      button.setTitle("Subscribe", for: .normal)
      button.setImage(UIImage(systemName: "plus"), for: .normal)
      button.setTitleColor(.systemOrange, for: .normal)
      button.tintColor = .systemOrange
      return button
  }.environment(\.sizeCategory, sizeCategory)
   .previewDisplayName("\(sizeCategory)")
}.previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)
 .padding(10)
```

</div>

## Previewing Different Locales

Xcode Previews are especially time-saving when it comes to
localizing an app into multiple languages.
Compared to the hassle of configuring Simulator
back and forth between different languages and regions,
this new approach makes a world of difference.

Let's say that, in addition to English,
your app supported various [right-to-left languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left).
You could verify that your
<abbr title="Right-to-Left">RTL</abbr> logic worked as expected like so:

<div class="code-with-automatic-preview">

```swift
let supportedLocales: [Locale] = [
  "en-US", // English (United States)
  "ar-QA", // Arabic (Qatar)
  "he-IL", // Hebrew (Israel)
  "ur-IN"  // Urdu (India)
].map(Locale.init(identifier:))

func localizedString(_ key: String, for locale: Locale) -> String? { <#...#> }

return ForEach(supportedLocales, id: \.identifier) { locale in
  UIViewPreview {
    let button = BorderedButton(frame: .zero)
    button.setTitle(localizedString("Subscribe", for: locale), for: .normal)
    button.setImage(UIImage(systemName: "plus"), for: .normal)
    button.setTitleColor(.systemOrange, for: .normal)
    button.tintColor = .systemOrange
    return button
  }.environment(\.locale, locale)
   .previewDisplayName(Locale.current.localizedString(forIdentifier: locale.identifier))
}.previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)
 .padding(10)
```

<aside>
{% asset swiftui-preview-locales.png alt="SwiftUI previews with different locales" %}
</aside>

</div>

{% info %}

We don't know of an easy way to use `NSLocalizedString` with an explicit locale.
You could go to the trouble of retrieving localized strings
from a strings file in your bundle,
but in most cases,
you'll be just fine hard-coding text in your previews.

{% endinfo %}

## Previewing View Controllers on Different Devices

SwiftUI previews aren't limited to views,
you can also use them with view controllers.
By creating a [custom `UIViewControllerPreview` type](https://gist.github.com/mattt/ff6b58af8576c798485b449269d43607)
and taking advantage of some
[new `UIStoryboard` class methods in iOS 13](https://nshipster.com/ios-13/#remove-implicitly-unwrapped-optionals-from-view-controllers-initialized-from-storyboards),
we can easily preview our view controller
on various devices ---
one on top of another:

<div class="code-with-automatic-preview">

```swift
#if canImport(SwiftUI) && DEBUG
import SwiftUI

let deviceNames: [String] = [
    "iPhone SE",
    "iPhone 11 Pro Max",
    "iPad Pro (11-inch)"
]

@available(iOS 13.0, *)
struct ViewController_Preview: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    ForEach(deviceNames, id: \.self) { deviceName in
      UIViewControllerPreview {
        UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
            .instantiateInitialViewController { coder in
            ViewController(coder: coder)
        }!
      }.previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: deviceName))
        .previewDisplayName(deviceName)
    }
  }
}
#endif
```

<aside>
{% asset swiftui-preview-devices.png alt="SwiftUI previews with different devices" %}
</aside>

</div>

{% error %}

There's currently no way to get SwiftUI device previews in landscape orientation.
Although you can approximate this with a fixed size preview layout,
be aware that it won't respect Safe Area on iPhone
or render split views correctly on iPad.

{% enderror %}

Although most of us are still some years away from shipping SwiftUI in our apps
(whether by choice or necessity),
we can all immediately benefit from the order-of-magnitude improvement
it enables with Xcode 11 on macOS Catalina.

By eliminating so much time spent waiting for things to happen,
we not only get (literally) _hours_ more time each week,
but we unlock the possibility of maintaining an unbroken flow state during that time.
Not only that,
but the convenience of integrated tests
fundamentally changes the calculus for testing:
instead of being a rare _"nice to have,"_
they're the new default.
Plus:
these inline previews serve as living documentation
that can help teams both large and small
finally get a handle on their design system.

It's hard to overstate how much of a game-changer Xcode Previews are for iOS development,
and we couldn't be happier to incorporate them into our workflow.
