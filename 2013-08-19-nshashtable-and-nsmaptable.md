`NSSet` and `NSDictionary`, along with `NSArray` are the workhorse collection classes of Foundation. Unlike [ other standard libraries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_collections_framework), implementation details are [hidden](http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/array.html) from developers, allowing them to write simple code and trust that it will be (reasonably) performant.

However, even the best abstractions break down; their underlying assumptions overturned. In these cases, developers either venture further down the abstraction, or, if available use a more general-purpose solution.

For `NSSet` and `NSDictionary`, the breaking assumption was in the memory behavior when storing objects in the collection. For `NSSet`, objects are a strongly referenced, as are `NSDictionary` values. Keys, on the other hand, are copied by `NSDictionary`. If a developer wanted to store a weak value, or use a non-`<NSCopying>`-conforming object as a key, they could be clever and use [`NSValue +valueWithNonretainedObject](http://nshipster.com/nsvalue/). Or, as of iOS 6 (and as far back as Mac OS X 10.5), they could use `NSHashTable` or `NSMapTable`, the more general-case counterparts to `NSSet` or `NSDictionary`, respectively.

So without further ado, here's everything you need to know about two of the more obscure members of Foundation's collections classes:

## `NSHashTable`

`NSHashTable` is a general-purpose analogue of `NSSet`. Contrasted with the behavior of `NSSet` / `NSMutableSet`, `NSHashTable` has the following characteristics:

- `NSSet` / `NSMutableSet` holds `strong` references to members, which are tested for hashing and equality using the methods `hash` and `isEqual:`.
- `NSHashTable` is mutable, without an immutable counterpart.
- `NSHashTable` can hold `weak` references to its members.
- `NSHashTable` can `copy` members on input.
- `NSHashTable` can contain arbitrary pointers, and use pointer identity for equality and hashing checks.

### Usage

~~~{objective-c}
NSHashTable *hashTable = [NSHashTable hashTableWithOptions:NSPointerFunctionsCopyIn];
[hashTable addObject:@"foo"];
[hashTable addObject:@"bar"];
[hashTable addObject:@42];
[hashTable removeObject:@"bar"];
NSLog(@"Members: %@", [hashTable allObjects]);
~~~

`NSHashTable` objects are initialized with an option for any of the following behaviors. Deprecated enum values are due to `NSHashTable` being ported from Garbage-Collected Mac OS X to ARC-ified iOS. Other values are aliased to options defined by [NSPointerFunctions](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPointerFunctions_Class/Introduction/Introduction.html), which will be covered next week on NSHipster.

> - `NSHashTableStrongMemory`: Equal to `NSPointerFunctionsStrongMemory`. This is default behavior, equivalent to `NSSet` member storage.
> - `NSHashTableWeakMemory`: Equal to `NSPointerFunctionsWeakMemory`. Uses weak read and write barriers. Using `NSPointerFunctionsWeakMemory` object references will turn to `NULL` on last release.
> - `NSHashTableZeroingWeakMemory`: This option has been deprecated. Instead use the `NSHashTableWeakMemory` option.
> - `NSHashTableCopyIn`: Use the memory acquire function to allocate and copy items on input (see [`NSPointerFunction -acquireFunction`](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPointerFunctions_Class/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/NSPointerFunctions/acquireFunction)). Equal to `NSPointerFunctionsCopyIn`.
> - `NSHashTableObjectPointerPersonality`: Use shifted pointer for the hash value and direct comparison to determine equality; use the description method for a description. Equal to `NSPointerFunctionsObjectPointerPersonality`.

## `NSMapTable`

`NSMapTable` is a general-purpose analogue of `NSDictionary`. Contrasted with the behavior of `NSDictionary` / `NSMutableDictionary`, `NSMapTable` has the following characteristics:

- `NSDictionary` / `NSMutableDictionary` copies keys, and holds strong references to values.
- `NSMapTable` is mutable, without an immutable counterpart.
- `NSMapTable` can hold keys and values with `weak` references, in such a way that entries are removed when either the key or value is dereferenced.
- `NSMapTable` can `copy` its values on input.
- `NSMapTable` can contain arbitrary pointers, and use pointer identity for equality and hashing checks.

### Usage

Instances where one might use `NSMapTable` include non-copyable keys and storing weak references to keyed delegates or another kind of weak object.

~~~{objective-c}
id delegate = ...;
NSMapTable *mapTable = [NSMapTable mapTableWithKeyOptions:NSMapTableStrongMemory 
                                             valueOptions:NSMapTableWeakMemory];
[mapTable setObject:delegate forKey:@"foo"];
NSLog(@"Keys: %@", [[mapTable keyEnumerator] allObjects]);
~~~

`NSMapTable` objects are initialized with options specifying behavior for both keys and values, using the following enum values:

> - `NSMapTableStrongMemory`: Specifies a strong reference from the map table to its contents.
> - `NSMapTableWeakMemory`: Uses weak read and write barriers appropriate for ARC or GC. Using NSPointerFunctionsWeakMemory object references will turn to NULL on last release. Equal to `NSMapTableZeroingWeakMemory`.
> - `NSHashTableZeroingWeakMemory`: This option has been superseded by the `NSMapTableWeakMemory` option.
> - `NSMapTableCopyIn` Use the memory acquire function to allocate and copy items on input (see acquireFunction (see [`NSPointerFunction -acquireFunction`](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPointerFunctions_Class/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/NSPointerFunctions/acquireFunction)). Equal to NSPointerFunctionsCopyIn.
> - `NSMapTableObjectPointerPersonality`: Use shifted pointer hash and direct equality, object description.
Equal to `NSPointerFunctionsObjectPointerPersonality`.

### Subscripting

After looking at a few code examples, a clever NSHipster may have thought "why aren't we using [object subscripting](http://nshipster.com/object-subscripting/)?". A particularly enterprising NSHipster may even have gotten a few lines of code into implementing a subscripting category for `NSMapTable`!

So why doesn't `NSMapTable` implement subscripting? Take a look at these method signatures:

~~~{objective-c}
- (id)objectForKeyedSubscript:(id <NSCopying>)key;
- (void)setObject:(id)obj forKeyedSubscript:(id <NSCopying>)key;
~~~

Notice that the `key` argument is of type `<NSCopying>`. This is great for `NSDictionary` `NSMutableDictionary`, but we can't make that assumption for `NSMapTable`. And so we arrive at an impasse: with an `id <NSCopying>` type, we can't implement for `NSMapTable`, however if object subscripting methods were to drop the `<NSCopying>` constraint, then we would miss out on the compiler check in `NSMutableDictionary` `-setObject:forKeyedSubscript:`.

So it goes. Honestly, in a situation where `NSMapTable` is merited, syntactic sugar is probably the least of one's concerns.

As always, it's important to remember that programming is not about being clever: always approach a problem from the highest viable level of abstraction. `NSSet` and `NSDictionary` are _great_ classes. For 99% of problems, they are undoubtedly the correct tool for the job. If, however, your problem has any of the particular memory management constraints described above, then `NSHashTable` & `NSMapTable` may be worth a look.
