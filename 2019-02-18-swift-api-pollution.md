When you import a module into Swift code,
you expect the result to be entirely additive.
That is to say:
the potential for new functionality comes at no expense
(other than, say, a modest increase in the size of your app bundle).

Import the `NaturalLanguage` framework,
and _**\*boom\***_ your app can
[determine the language of text](https://nshipster.com/nllanguagerecognizer/);
import `CoreMotion`,
and _**\*whoosh\***_ your app can
[respond to changes in device orientation](https://nshipster.com/cmdevicemotion/).
But it'd be surprising if, say,
the ability to distinguish between French and Japanese
interfered with your app's ability to tell which way was magnetic north.

Although this particular example isn't real
(to the relief of Francophones in Hokkaido),
there are situations in which a Swift dependency
can change how your app behaves ---
_even if you don't use it directly_.

In this week's article,
we'll look at a few ways that imported modules can
silently change the behavior of existing code,
and offer suggestions for how to
prevent this from happening as an API provider
and mitigate the effects of this as an API consumer.

## Module Pollution

It's a story as old as `<time.h>`:
two things are called `Foo`,
and the compiler has to decide what to do.

Pretty much every language with a mechanism for code reuse
has to deal with <dfn>naming collisions</dfn> one way or another.
In the case of Swift,
you can use <dfn>fully-qualified names</dfn> to distinguish
between the `Foo` type declared in module `A` (`A.Foo`)
from the `Foo` type in module `B` (`B.Foo`).
However, Swift has some unique characteristics
that cause other ambiguities to go unnoticed by the compiler,
which may result in a change to existing behavior
when modules are imported.

{% info %}
For the purposes of this article,
we use the term <dfn>pollution</dfn>
to describe such side-effects caused by importing Swift modules
that aren't surfaced by the compiler.
We're not 100% on this terminology,
so please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/nshipster)
if you can think of any other suggestions.
{% endinfo %}

### Operator Overloading

In Swift,
the `+` operator denotes <dfn>concatenation</dfn>
when its operands are arrays.
One array plus another results in
an array with the elements of the former array followed by those of the latter.

```swift
let oneTwoThree: [Int] = [1, 2, 3]
let fourFiveSix: [Int] = [4, 5, 6]
oneTwoThree + fourFiveSix // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

If we look at the operator's
[declaration in the standard library](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/Array.swift#L1318-L1324),
we see that it's provided in an unqualified extension on `Array`:

```swift
extension Array {
  @inlinable public static func + (lhs: Array, rhs: Array) -> Array {}
}
```

The Swift compiler is responsible for
resolving API calls to their corresponding implementations.
If an invocation matches more than one declaration,
the compiler selects the most specific one available.

To illustrate this point,
consider the following conditional extension on `Array`,
which defines the `+` operator to perform <dfn>member-wise addition</dfn>
for arrays whose elements conform to `Numeric`:

```swift
extension Array where Element: Numeric {
    public static func + (lhs: Array, rhs: Array) -> Array {
        return Array(zip(lhs, rhs).map {$0 + $1})
    }
}

oneTwoThree + fourFiveSix // [5, 7, 9] üòï
```

Because the requirement of `Element: Numeric`
is more specific than the unqualified declaration in the standard library,
the Swift compiler resolves `+` to this function instead.

Now,
these new semantics may be perfectly acceptable --- indeed preferable.
But only if you're aware of them.
The problem is that
if you so much as _import_ a module containing such a declaration
you can change the behavior of your entire app without even knowing it.

This problem isn't limited to matters of semantics;
it can also come about as a result of ergonomic affordances.

### Function Shadowing

In Swift,
function declarations can specify default arguments for trailing parameters,
making them optional (though not necessarily `Optional`) for callers.
For example,
the top-level function
[`dump(_:name:indent:maxDepth:maxItems:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1539127-dump)
has an intimidating number of parameters:

```swift
@discardableResult func dump<T>(_ value: T, name: String? = nil, indent: Int = 0, maxDepth: Int = .max, maxItems: Int = .max) -> T
```

But thanks to default arguments,
you need only specify the first one to call it:

```swift
dump("üè≠üí®") // "üè≠üí®"
```

Alas,
this source of convenience can become a point of confusion
when method signatures overlap.

Imagine a hypothetical module that ---
not being familiar with the built-in `dump` function ---
defines a `dump(_:)` that prints the UTF-8 code units of a string.

```swift
public func dump(_ string: String) {
    print(string.utf8.map {$0})
}
```

The `dump` function declared in the Swift standard library
takes an unqualified generic `T` argument in its first parameter
(which is effectively `Any`).
Because `String` is a more specific type,
the Swift compiler will choose the imported `dump(_:)` method
when it's available.

```swift
dump("üè≠üí®") // [240, 159, 143, 173, 240, 159, 146, 168]
```

Unlike the previous example,
it's not entirely clear that there's any ambiguity
in the competing declarations.
After all,
what reason would a developer have to think that their `dump(_:)` method
could in any way be confused for `dump(_:name:indent:maxDepth:maxItems:)`?

Which leads us to our final example,
which is perhaps the most confusing of all...

### String Interpolation Pollution

In Swift,
you can combine two strings by interpolation in a string literal
as an alternative to concatenation.

```swift
let name = "Swift"
let greeting = "Hello, \(name)!" // "Hello, Swift!"
```

This has been true from the first release of Swift.
However, with the new
[`ExpressibleByStringInterpolation`](/expressiblebystringinterpolation)
protocol in Swift 5,
this behavior can no longer be taken for granted.

Consider the following extension on the default interpolation type for `String`:

```swift
extension DefaultStringInterpolation {
    public mutating func appendInterpolation<T>(_ value: T) where T: StringProtocol {
        self.appendInterpolation(value.uppercased() as TextOutputStreamable)
    }
}
```

`StringProtocol` inherits,
[among other things](https://swiftdoc.org/v4.2/protocol/stringprotocol/)
the `TextOutputStreamable` and `CustomStringConvertible` protocols,
making it more specific than the
[`appendInterpolation` method declared by `DefaultStringInterpolation`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/StringInterpolation.swift#L63)
that would otherwise be invoked when interpolating `String` values.

```swift
public struct DefaultStringInterpolation: StringInterpolationProtocol {
    @inlinable public mutating func appendInterpolation<T>(_ value: T)
        where T: TextOutputStreamable, T: CustomStringConvertible {}
}
```

Once again,
the Swift compiler's notion of specificity
causes behavior to go from expected to unexpected.

If the previous declaration is made accessible by any module in your app,
it would change the behavior of all interpolated string values.

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, \(name)!" // "Hello, SWIFT!"
```

{% info %}
Admittedly, this last example's a bit contrived;
an implementor has to go out of their way
to make the implementation not recursive.
But consider this a stand-in for a less-obvious example
that's more likely to actually happen in real-life.
{% endinfo %}

Given the rapid and upward trajectory of the language,
it's not unreasonable to expect that these problems will be solved
at some point in the future.

But what are we to do in the meantime?
Here are some suggestions for managing this behavior
both as an API consumer and as an API provider.

---

## Strategies for API Consumers

As an API consumer,
you are --- in many ways ---
beholden to the constraints imposed by imported dependencies.
It really _shouldn't_ be your problem to solve,
but at least there are some remedies available to you.

### Add Hints to the Compiler

Often,
the most effective way to get the compiler to do what you want
is to explicitly cast an argument down to a type
that matches the method you want to call.

Take our example of the `dump(_:)` method from before:
by downcasting to `CustomStringConvertible` from `String`,
we can get the compiler to resolve the call
to use the standard library function instead.

```swift
dump("üè≠üí®") // [240, 159, 143, 173, 240, 159, 146, 168]
dump("üè≠üí®" as CustomStringConvertible) // "üè≠üí®"
```

### <del>Scoped Import Declarations</del>

{% warning %}
As discussed in [a previous article](/import)
you can use Swift import declarations to resolve naming collisions.

Unfortunately,
scoping an import to certain APIs in a module
doesn't currently prevent extensions from applying to existing types.
That is to say,
you can't import an `adding(_:)` method
without also importing an overloaded `+` operator declared in that module.
{% endwarning %}

### Fork Dependencies

If all else fails,
you can always solve the problem
by taking it into your own hands.

If you don't like something that a third-party dependency is doing,
simply fork the source code,
get rid of the stuff you don't want,
and use that instead.
(You could even try to get them to upstream the change.)

{% error %}
Unfortunately,
this strategy won't work for closed-source modules,
including the ones in Apple's SDKs.
_["Radar or GTFO"](/bug-reporting/)_, I suppose.
{% enderror %}

## Strategies for API Provider

As someone developing an API,
it's ultimately your responsibility to be deliberate and considerate
in your design decisions.
As you think about the greater consequences of your actions,
here are some things to keep in mind:

### Be More Discerning with Generic Constraints

Unqualified `<T>` generic constraints are the same as `Any`.
If it makes sense to do so,
consider making your constraints more specific
to reduce the chance of overlap with unrelated declarations.

### Isolate Core Functionality from Convenience

As a general rule,
code should be organized into modules
such that module is responsible for a single responsibility.

If it makes sense to do so,
consider packaging functionality provided by types and methods
in a module that is separate from
any extensions you provide to built-in types to improve their usability.
Until it's possible to pick and choose which behavior we want from a module,
the best option is to give consumers the choice to opt-in to features
if there's a chance that they might cause problems downstream.

### Avoid Collisions Altogether

Of course,
it'd be great if you could knowingly avoid collisions to begin with...
but that gets into the whole
_["unknown unknowns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns)_ thing,
and we don't have time to get into epistemology now.

So for now,
let's just say that if you're aware of something _maybe_ being a conflict,
a good option might be to avoid it altogether.

For example,
if you're worried that someone might get huffy about
changing the semantics of fundamental arithmetic operators,
you could choose a different one instead, like `.+`:

```swift
infix operator .+: AdditionPrecedence

extension Array where Element: Numeric {
    static func .+ (lhs: Array, rhs: Array) -> Array {
        return Array(zip(lhs, rhs).map {$0 + $1})
    }
}

oneTwoThree + fourFiveSix // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
oneTwoThree .+ fourFiveSix // [5, 7, 9]
```

---

As developers,
we're perhaps less accustomed to considering the wider impact of our decisions.
Code is invisible and weightless,
so it's easy to forget that it even exists
after we ship it.

But in Swift,
our decisions have impacts beyond what's immediately understood
so it's important to be considerate about how we exercise our responsibilities
as stewards of our APIs.
