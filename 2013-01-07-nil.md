Understanding the concept of nothingness is as much a philosophical issue as it is a pragmatic one. We are inhabitants of a universe of _somethings_, yet reason in a logical universe of existential uncertainties. As a physical manifestation of a logical system, computers are faced with the intractable problem of how to represent _nothing_ with _something_.

In Objective-C, there are several different varieties of _nothing_. The reason for this goes back to [a common NSHipster refrain](http://nshipster.com/ns_enum-ns_options/), of how Objective-C bridges the procedural paradigm of C with Smalltalk-inspired object-oriented paradigm.

C represents _nothing_ as `0` for primitive values, and `NULL` for pointers ([which is equivalent to `0` in a pointer context](http://c-faq.com/null/nullor0.html)).

Objective-C builds on C's representation of _nothing_ by adding `nil`. `nil` is an _object_ pointer to nothing. Although semantically distinct from `NULL`, they are technically equivalent to one another.

On the framework level, Foundation defines `NSNull`, which defines a class method, `+null`, which returns the singleton `NSNull` object. `NSNull` is different from `nil` or `NULL`, in that it is an actual object, rather than a zero value.

Additionally, in [Foundation/NSObjCRuntime.h](https://gist.github.com/4469665), `Nil` is defined as a _class_ pointer to nothing. This lesser-known title-case cousin of `nil` doesn't show up much very often, but it's at least worth noting.

## There's Something About `nil`

Newly-`alloc`'d `NSObject`s start life with [their contents set to `0`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSObject_Class/Reference/Reference.html). This means that all pointers that object has to other objects begin as `nil`, so it's unnecessary to, for instance, set `self.(association) = nil` in `init` methods.

Perhaps the most notable behavior of `nil`, though, is that it can have messages sent to it.

In other languages, like C++, this would crash your program, but in Objective-C, invoking a method on `nil` returns a zero value. This greatly simplifies expressions, as it obviates the need to check for `nil` before doing anything:

~~~{objective-c}
// For example, this expression...
if (name != nil && [name isEqualToString:@"Steve"]) { ... }

// ...can be simplified to:
if ([name isEqualToString:@"Steve"]) { ... }
~~~

Being aware of how `nil` works in Objective-C allows this convenience to be a feature, and not a lurking bug in your application. Make sure to guard against cases where `nil` values are unwanted, either by checking and returning early to fail silently, or adding a `NSParameterAssert` to throw an exception.

## `NSNull`: Something for Nothing

`NSNull` is used throughout Foundation and other frameworks to skirt around the limitations of collections like `NSArray` and `NSDictionary` not being able to contain `nil` values. You can think of `NSNull` as effectively [boxing][1] the `NULL` or `nil` value so that it can be used in collections:

~~~{objective-c}
NSMutableDictionary *mutableDictionary = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
mutableDictionary[@"someKey"] = [NSNull null]; // Sets value of NSNull singleton for `someKey`
NSLog(@"Keys: %@", [mutableDictionary allKeys]); // @[@"someKey"]
~~~

So to recap, here are the four values representing _nothing_ that every Objective-C programmer should know about:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Value</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>NULL</tt></td>
      <td><tt>(void *)0</tt></td>
      <td>literal null value for C pointers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>nil</tt></td>
      <td><tt>(id)0</tt></td>
      <td>literal null value for Objective-C objects</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>Nil</tt></td>
      <td><tt>(Class)0</tt></td>
      <td>literal null value for Objective-C classes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>NSNull</tt></td>
      <td><tt>[NSNull null]</tt></td>
      <td>singleton object used to represent null</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
