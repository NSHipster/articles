This Thursday is [Thanksgiving][american thanksgiving] in the United States,
a holiday in which we'll gather together to cultivate and express gratitude
against a backdrop of turkey, mashed potatoes, and
origin-myths of European colonialism in the Americas.

{% info %}

[Canadian Thanksgiving][canadian thanksgiving]
is celebrated on the second Monday in October ---
coincidentally, the day Americans observe
<del>Columbus Day</del>
<ins>[Indigenous Peoples' Day][indigenous peoples day]</ins>.

<!-- Thanks a lot, Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968! -->

As the year ---
_and indeed the decade_ ---
draws to a close,
we're invited to reflect on the blessings in our lives:
The individuals who fill them with joy,
the circumstances that bring them comfort and security,
the pursuits that endow them with meaning.

...of course, it's also a time of ritualized, over-indulgent consumption.
And for the PC gamers among us,
that means shutting down our Macs,
booting into our [Windows][boot camp] partitions,
and settling into our long-neglected back catalogs on Steam.

<hr/>

So while you wait for your AAA titles to download
and your Windows software updates to apply
_(let's assume you're reading this on your iPhone)_,
we invite you to count your blessings.

<hr/>

This week on NSHipster:
a quick look at the `bless` command and the macOS boot process.

But first, a quick disclaimer:

{% warning %}

If you want to boot into your Windows partition,
skip the command-line entirely.
Instead, open the Startup Disk preference pane,
select `BOOTCAMP`,
and click the Restart button.

<aside class="parenthetical">
Alternatively, you can hold down 
the option (<kbd title="option">‚å•</kbd>) "snag" key
during startup to select a startup volume.
</aside>

</picture>

If you search the Web for
_"how to set Boot Camp as startup disk from Terminal"_,
you'll find plenty of old blog posts that mention `bless`.
However, for reasons that we'll discuss later on,
this won't work on the latest Mac hardware and software.

The process of booting a computer is a small miracle.
Starting with nothing ---
<em lang="la">"tabula rasa"</em> ---
a computer incrementally runs smaller, simpler programs
to load larger, more capable programs into memory,
until it finally has everything it needs to
run the operating system itself.

In a previous era of computers,
operating systems were initialized using
[<abbr title="Basic Input/Output System">BIOS</abbr>][bios] firmware,
which came pre-installed in system
<abbr title="read-only memory">ROM</abbr>.
When a machine powered up,
that firmware would be the first thing that the computer encountered,
and it'd proceed to load machine code from the [boot sector][boot sector].

Nowadays,
Macs and most other computers boot according to the
<dfn>[Extensible Firmware Interface][efi]</dfn>
(<abbr title="Extensible Firmware Interface">EFI</abbr>),
which introduces a few levels of indirection for greater flexibility.
When a machine powers on under this regime,
it loads a boot manager,
which is responsible for loading configuration from
<dfn>non-volatile RAM</dfn>
(<abbr title="non-volatile random access memory">NVRAM</abbr>),
including the file system paths of the
loaders and kernels for the operating system.
This additional step allows computers to
boot into different partitions on disk
and even network volumes.

{% info %}

For the curious,
you can see what variables are currently set in <abbr>NVRAM</abbr>
by running the following command:

```terminal
$ nvram -x -p                           |
    xmllint --xpath "//key" -           |
    sed -E "s#<key>([^<]+)</key>#\1,#g" |
    tr "," "\n"
HW_BOOT_DATA
IONVRAM-SYNCNOW-PROPERTY
LocationServicesEnabled
SleepWakeFailureString
<#...#>
```

{% endinfo %}

The process of making a volume bootable is called <dfn>blessing</dfn>,
and the operative command to accomplish this has been, historically,
[`bless`][bless].

{% info %}

Long before Boot Camp,
in the early days of Mac OS X,
one of the common uses of the `bless` command
was booting into your ["Classic"][classic mac os] Mac OS 9 partition:

```terminal
# Boot into Mac OS 9
sudo bless -folder9 '/Volumes/Mac OS 9/System Folder' -setOF

# Boot into Mac OS X
sudo bless -folder '/System/Library/CoreServices' -setOF
```

{% endinfo %}

To get an overview of the blessed volumes on your machine,
run `bless --info`:

<aside class="parenthetical">
If you're on a Mac booted from an <abbr>APFS</abbr> disk,
you'll need to prepend `sudo` to run the `bless` command.
</aside>

```terminal
$ sudo bless --info
<#...#> => Blessed System File is {Preboot}/<#...#>/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi
<#...#> => Blessed System Folder is {Preboot}/<#...#>/System/Library/CoreServices
The blessed volume in this APFS container is "/".
No blessed APFS snapshot for this volume.
```

{% error %}

Unless you know what you're doing,
that's pretty much the extent to which you should be invoking the `bless` command.
Other usage can cause your Mac to become unbootable,
so exercise caution.

{% enderror %}

Blessing a volume on the latest Mac hardware running the latest version of macOS
is an involved process,
which includes
(among other things):

- Copying `boot.efi` to the correct file system path on the volume
- Writing information to the volume header to designate it as being bootable
- Setting the `efi-boot-device` and `efi-boot-device-data` variables
  to designate the volume as the next startup disk

To illustrate how much complexity is baked into blessing a volume,
let's focus on the first of these tasks:

> Copy `boot.efi`? Easy: `cp boot.efi "/Volumes/Macintosh HD"`. \\
> (<q>It's a UNIX system! I know this!</q>)

_Well, not quite._

On a Mac booted from an <abbr>APFS</abbr> disk,
`boot.efi` is in a special preboot volume (`/dev/disk1s2`),
at a path containing a generated UUID.
<abbr>HFS+</abbr> is rather simpler by comparison,
since the boot loader has a hard-coded located at
`/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi`.
That is, unless,
the disk is encrypted with [FileVault full-disk encryption][filevault]
or is part of a RAID array that requires additional drivers.
And all of this is to say nothing of [Secure Boot][secure boot]
and the [Apple T2 Security Chip][t2],
which comes standard on the iMac Pro as well as
Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro computers since 2018.

But in case you remain undeterred,
and _really_ want to avoid the inconvenience of opening up System Preferences,
here's the invocation you seek:

```terminal
$ sudo bless -mount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP -setBoot --nextonly
Could not set boot device property: 0xe00002e2
```

However,
that hasn't worked since the advent of
[System Integrity Protection][sip]
(<abbr title="System Integrity Protection">SIP</abbr>)
in macOS 10.11.

A suggested workaround invokes `systemsetup`
as a replacement for `bless`.

The [`systemsetup`][systemsetup] command is similar to System Preferences,
in that it can be used to set machine-wide preferences,
including:
date and time settings,
remote login and Apple Events and
the behavior of the physical power button,
as well as when a computer should go to sleep and
what should happen after a power failure.

The `systemsetup` invocation to set the startup disk
goes a little something like this:

```terminal
$ sudo systemsetup -setstartupdisk /Volume/BOOTCAMP/Windows
Setting startup disk not allowed while System Integrity Protection is enabled.
```

But that, too,
doesn't seem to work on recent versions of macOS
without disabling <abbr>SIP</abbr>
_(and for the vast majority of folks,
there's never a good reason to do this)_.

<aside class="parenthetical">
And again,
that's assuming you aren't on a Mac with a T2 chip.
We don't have one to test this ourselves,
but apparently, 
you must first boot into recovery mode to disable <abbr>SIP</abbr>.
</aside>

<hr/>

So by now,
Windows has finished updating itself _(maybe)_,
the game is 100% downloaded and ready to launch,
and you're left wondering
_"What's the point of this article?"_

To that, dear reader,
I'd first say that there are far, _far_ worse things than being pointless
_(or [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co), as it were)_.
But if you're still searching for a takeaway,
here it is:

> You probably won't ever have an occasion to use the `bless` command
> _(or `systemsetup`, for that matter)_.

With every design decision,
software vendors perform a balancing act between security and convenience.
For most people,
the new security features in recent versions of macOS and new Apple hardware
make them undeniably safer,
usually without any perceivable downside.
Yet we, as developers,
especially those of us with a hacker mentality,
may see the Mac's trajectory towards a closed, iOS-like security model
as a mixed blessing ---
a curse, even.

If that's the case for you
_(and even if it isn't)_,
then please allow us to offer another helping of article-concluding takeaway:
