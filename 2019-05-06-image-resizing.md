Since time immemorial, iOS developers have been perplexed by a singular question:

_"How do you resize an image?"_

It's a question of beguiling clarity,
spurred on by a mutual mistrust of developer and platform.
Myriad code samples litter Stack Overflow,
each claiming to be the One True Solutionâ„¢ ---
all others, mere pretenders.

In this week's article,
we'll look at 5 distinct techniques to image resizing on iOS
(and macOS, making the appropriate `UIImage` â†’ `NSImage` conversions).
But rather than prescribe a single approach for every situation,
we'll weigh ergonomics against performance benchmarks
to better understand when to use one approach over another.

by downloading, building, and running

## When and Why to Scale Images

Before we get too far ahead of ourselves,
let's establish _why_ you'd need to resize images in the first place.
After all,
`UIImageView` automatically scales and crops images
according to the behavior specified by its
[`contentMode` property](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622619-contentmode).
And in the vast majority of cases,
`.scaleAspectFit`, `.scaleAspectFill`, or `.scaleToFill`
provides exactly the behavior you need.

```swift
imageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
imageView.image = image
```

---

So when does it make sense to resize an image?<br/>
**When it's significantly larger than the image view that's displaying it.**

---

Consider [this stunning image of the Earth](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=78314),
from [<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>'s Visible Earth image catalog](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov):

{% asset image-resizing-earth.jpg %}

At its full resolution,
this image measures 12,000 px square
and weighs in at a whopping 20 MB.
You might not think much of a few megabytes given today's hardware,
but that's just its compressed size.
To display it,
a `UIImageView` needs to first decode that JPEG into a bitmap.
If you were to set this full-sized image on an image view as-is,
your app's memory usage would balloon to
**hundreds of Megabytes of memory**
with no appreciable benefit to the user
(a screen can only display so many pixels, after all).

By simply resizing that image to the size of the image view
before setting its `image` property,
you can use an order-of-magnitude less RAM:

|                      | Memory Usage _(MB)_ |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Without Downsampling | 220.2               |
| With Downsampling    | 23.7                |

This technique is known as <dfn>downsampling</dfn>,
and can significantly improve the performance of your app
in these kinds of situations.
If you're interested in some more information about downsampling
and other image and graphics best practices,
please refer to
[this excellent session from WWDC 2018](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/219/).

Now,
few apps would ever try to load an image this large...
but it's not _too_ far off from some of the assets I've gotten back from designer.
_(Seriously, a 3MB PNG for a color gradient?)_
So with that in mind,
let's take a look at the various ways that you can go about
resizing and downsampling images.

{% error %}

This should go without saying,
but all of the examples loading images from a URL are for **local** files.
Remember, it's **never** a good idea to do networking
synchronously on the main thread of your app.

## Image Resizing Techniques

There are a number of different approaches to resizing an image,
each with different capabilities and performance characteristics.
And the examples we're looking at in this article
span frameworks both low- and high-level,
from Core Graphics, vImage, and Image I/O
to Core Image and UIKit:

1. [Drawing to a UIGraphicsImageRenderer](#technique-1-drawing-to-a-uigraphicsimagerenderer)
2. [Drawing to a Core Graphics Context](#technique-2-drawing-to-a-core-graphics-context)
3. [Creating a Thumbnail with Image I/O](#technique-3-creating-a-thumbnail-with-image-io)
4. [Lanczos Resampling with Core Image](#technique-4-lanczos-resampling-with-core-image)
5. [Image Scaling with vImage](#technique-5-image-scaling-with-vimage)

For consistency,
each of the following techniques share a common interface:

```swift
func resizedImage(at url: URL, for size: CGSize) -> UIImage? { <#...#> }

imageView.image = resizedImage(at: url, for: size)
```

Here, `size` is a measure of point size,
rather than pixel size.
To calculate the equivalent pixel size for your resized image,
scale the size of your image view frame by the `scale` of your main `UIScreen`:

```swift
let scaleFactor = UIScreen.main.scale
let scale = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: scaleFactor, y: scaleFactor)
let size = imageView.bounds.size.applying(scale)
```

{% info %}
If you're loading a large image asynchronously,
use a transition to have the image fade-in when set on the image view.
For example:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet var imageView: UIImageView!

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)

        let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "Blue Marble West",
                                withExtension: "tiff")!

        DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
            let image = resizedImage(at: url, for: self.imageView.bounds.size)

            DispatchQueue.main.sync {
                UIView.transition(with: self.imageView,
                                duration: 1.0,
                                options: [.curveEaseOut, .transitionCrossDissolve],
                                animations: {
                                    self.imageView.image = image
                                })
            }
        }
    }
}
```

{% endinfo %}

### Technique #1: Drawing to a UIGraphicsImageRenderer

The highest-level APIs for image resizing are found in the UIKit framework.
Given a `UIImage`,
you can draw into a `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` context
to render a scaled-down version of that image:

```swift
import UIKit

// Technique #1
func resizedImage(at url: URL, for size: CGSize) -> UIImage? {
    guard let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: url.path) else {
        return nil
    }

    let renderer = UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: size)
    return renderer.image { (context) in
        image.draw(in: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size))
    }
}
```

[`UIGraphicsImageRenderer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigraphicsimagerenderer)
is a relatively new API,
introduced in iOS 10 to replace the older,
`UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions` / `UIGraphicsEndImageContext` APIs.
You construct a `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` by specifying a point `size`.
The `image` method takes a closure argument
and returns a bitmap that results from executing the passed closure.
In this case,
the result is the original image scaled down to draw within the specified bounds.

{% info %}

It's often useful to scale the original size
to fit within a frame without changing the original aspect ratio.
[`AVMakeRect(aspectRatio:insideRect:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/1390116-avmakerect)
is a handy function found in the AVFoundation framework
that takes care of that calculation for you:

```swift
import func AVFoundation.AVMakeRect
let rect = AVMakeRect(aspectRatio: image.size, insideRect: imageView.bounds)
```

{% endinfo %}

### Technique #2: Drawing to a Core Graphics Context

Core Graphics / Quartz 2D
offers a lower-level set of APIs
that allow for more advanced configuration.

Given a `CGImage`,
a temporary bitmap context is used to render the scaled image,
using the `draw(_:in:)` method:

```swift
import UIKit
import CoreGraphics

// Technique #2
func resizedImage(at url: URL, for size: CGSize) -> UIImage? {
    guard let imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as NSURL, nil),
        let image = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(imageSource, 0, nil)
    else {
        return nil
    }

    let context = CGContext(data: nil,
                            width: Int(size.width),
                            height: Int(size.height),
                            bitsPerComponent: image.bitsPerComponent,
                            bytesPerRow: image.bytesPerRow,
                            space: image.colorSpace ?? CGColorSpace(name: CGColorSpace.sRGB)!,
                            bitmapInfo: image.bitmapInfo.rawValue)
    context?.interpolationQuality = .high
    context?.draw(image, in: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size))

    guard let scaledImage = context?.makeImage() else { return nil }

    return UIImage(cgImage: scaledImage)
}
```

This `CGContext` initializer takes several arguments to construct a context,
including the desired dimensions and
the amount of memory for each channel within a given color space.
In this example,
these parameters are fetched from the `CGImage` object.
Next, setting the `interpolationQuality` property to `.high`
instructs the context to interpolate pixels at a ðŸ‘Œ level of fidelity.
The `draw(_:in:)` method
draws the image at a given size and position, a
allowing for the image to be cropped on a particular edge
or to fit a set of image features, such as faces.
Finally,
the `makeImage()` method captures the information from the context
and renders it to a `CGImage` value
(which is then used to construct a `UIImage` object).

### Technique #3: Creating a Thumbnail with Image I/O

Image I/O is a powerful (albeit lesser-known) framework for working with images.
Independent of Core Graphics,
it can read and write between many different formats,
access photo metadata,
and perform common image processing operations.
The framework offers the fastest image encoders and decoders on the platform,
with advanced caching mechanisms ---
and even the ability to load images incrementally.

The important
`CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` offers a concise API with different options than found in equivalent Core Graphics calls:

```swift
import ImageIO

// Technique #3
func resizedImage(at url: URL, for size: CGSize) -> UIImage? {
    let options: [CFString: Any] = [
        kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageIfAbsent: true,
        kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,
        kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately: true,
        kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: max(size.width, size.height)
    ]

    guard let imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as NSURL, nil),
        let image = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(imageSource, 0, options as CFDictionary)
    else {
        return nil
    }

    return UIImage(cgImage: image)
}
```

Given a `CGImageSource` and set of options,
the `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(_:_:_:)` function
creates a thumbnail of an image.
Resizing is accomplished by the `kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize` option,
which specifies the maximum dimension
used to scale the image at its original aspect ratio.
By setting either the
`kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageIfAbsent` or
`kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways` option,
Image I/O automatically caches the scaled result for subsequent calls.

### Technique #4: Lanczos Resampling with Core Image

Core Image provides built-in
[Lanczos resampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_resampling) functionality
by way of the eponymous `CILanczosScaleTransform` filter.
Although arguably a higher-level API than UIKit,
the pervasive use of key-value coding in Core Image makes it unwieldy.

That said, at least the pattern is consistent.

The process of
creating a transform filter,
configuring it, and
rendering an output image
is no different from any other Core Image workflow:

```swift
import UIKit
import CoreImage

let sharedContext = CIContext(options: [.useSoftwareRenderer : false])

// Technique #4
func resizedImage(at url: URL, scale: CGFloat, aspectRatio: CGFloat) -> UIImage? {
    guard let image = CIImage(contentsOf: url) else {
        return nil
    }

    let filter = CIFilter(name: "CILanczosScaleTransform")
    filter?.setValue(image, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
    filter?.setValue(scale, forKey: kCIInputScaleKey)
    filter?.setValue(aspectRatio, forKey: kCIInputAspectRatioKey)

    guard let outputCIImage = filter?.outputImage,
        let outputCGImage = sharedContext.createCGImage(outputCIImage,
                                                        from: outputCIImage.extent)
    else {
        return nil
    }

    return UIImage(cgImage: outputCGImage)
}
```

The Core Image filter named `CILanczosScaleTransform`
accepts an `inputImage`, an `inputScale`, and an `inputAspectRatio` parameter,
each of which are pretty self-explanatory.

More interestingly,
a `CIContext` is used here to create a `UIImage`
(by way of a `CGImageRef` intermediary representation),
since `UIImage(CIImage:)` doesn't often work as expected.
Creating a `CIContext` is an expensive operation,
so a cached context is used for repeated resizing.

{% info %}

A `CIContext` can be created using either the GPU or the CPU (much slower) for rendering.
Specify the `.useSoftwareRenderer` the option in the initializer to choose which one to use.
_(Hint: Use the faster one, maybe?)_

{% endinfo %}

### Technique #5: Image Scaling with vImage

Last up,
it's the venerable [Accelerate framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate) ---
or more specifically,
the `vImage` image-processing sub-framework.

vImage comes with a
[bevy of different functions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/vimage/vimage_operations/image_scaling)
for scaling an image buffer.
These lower-level APIs promise high performance with low power consumption,
but at the cost of managing the buffers yourself
(not to mention, signficantly more code to write):

```swift
import UIKit
import Accelerate.vImage

// Technique #5
func resizedImage(at url: URL, for size: CGSize) -> UIImage? {
    // Decode the source image
    guard let imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as NSURL, nil),
        let image = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(imageSource, 0, nil),
        let properties = CGImageSourceCopyPropertiesAtIndex(imageSource, 0, nil) as? [CFString: Any],
        let imageWidth = properties[kCGImagePropertyPixelWidth] as? vImagePixelCount,
        let imageHeight = properties[kCGImagePropertyPixelHeight] as? vImagePixelCount
    else {
        return nil
    }

    // Define the image format
    var format = vImage_CGImageFormat(bitsPerComponent: 8,
                                      bitsPerPixel: 32,
                                      colorSpace: nil,
                                      bitmapInfo: CGBitmapInfo(rawValue: CGImageAlphaInfo.first.rawValue),
                                      version: 0,
                                      decode: nil,
                                      renderingIntent: .defaultIntent)

    var error: vImage_Error

    // Create and initialize the source buffer
    var sourceBuffer = vImage_Buffer()
    defer { sourceBuffer.data.deallocate() }
    error = vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage(&sourceBuffer,
                                         &format,
                                         nil,
                                         image,
                                         vImage_Flags(kvImageNoFlags))
    guard error == kvImageNoError else { return nil }

    // Create and initialize the destination buffer
    var destinationBuffer = vImage_Buffer()
    error = vImageBuffer_Init(&destinationBuffer,
                              vImagePixelCount(size.height),
                              vImagePixelCount(size.width),
                              format.bitsPerPixel,
                              vImage_Flags(kvImageNoFlags))
    guard error == kvImageNoError else { return nil }

    // Scale the image
    error = vImageScale_ARGB8888(&sourceBuffer,
                                 &destinationBuffer,
                                 nil,
                                 vImage_Flags(kvImageHighQualityResampling))
    guard error == kvImageNoError else { return nil }

    // Create a CGImage from the destination buffer
    guard let resizedImage =
        vImageCreateCGImageFromBuffer(&destinationBuffer,
                                      &format,
                                      nil,
                                      nil,
                                      vImage_Flags(kvImageNoAllocate),
                                      &error)?.takeRetainedValue(),
        error == kvImageNoError
    else {
        return nil
    }

    return UIImage(cgImage: resizedImage)
}
```

The Accelerate APIs used here clearly operate at a much lower-level
than any of the other resizing methods discussed so far.
But get past the unfriendly-looking type and function names,
and you'll find that this approach is rather straightforward.

- First, create a source buffer from your input image,
- Then, create a destination buffer to hold the scaled image
- Next, scale the image data in the source buffer to the destination buffer,
- Finally, create an image from the resulting image data in the destination buffer.

## Performance Benchmarks

So how do these various approaches stack up to one another?

Here are the results of some [performance benchmarks](/benchmarking/)
performed on an iPhone 7 running iOS 12.2,
in [this project](https://github.com/NSHipster/Image-Resizing-Example).

{% asset image-resizing-app-screenshot.png width="325" %}

The following numbers show the average runtime across multiple iterations
for loading, scaling, and displaying that
[jumbo-sized picture of the earth](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=78314)
from before:

|                                            | Time _(seconds)_ |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Technique #1: `UIKit`                      | 0.1420           |
| Technique #2: `Core Graphics` <sup>1</sup> | 0.1722           |
| Technique #3: `Image I/O`                  | 0.1616           |
| Technique #4: `Core Image` <sup>2</sup>    | 2.4983           |
| Technique #5: `vImage`                     | 2.3126           |

<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;
Results were consistent across different values of `CGInterpolationQuality`, with negligible differences in performance benchmarks.

<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;
Setting `kCIContextUseSoftwareRenderer` to `true` on the options passed on `CIContext` creation yielded results an order of magnitude slower than base results.

## Conclusions

- **UIKit**, **Core Graphics**, and **Image I/O**
  all perform well for scaling operations on most images.
  If you had to choose one (on iOS, at least),
  `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` is typically your best bet.
- **Core Image** is outperformed for image scaling operations.
  In fact,
  according to Apple's
  [_Performance Best Practices section of the Core Image Programming Guide_](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/graphicsimaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_performance/ci_performance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001185-CH10-SW1),
  you should use Core Graphics or Image I/O functions
  to crop and downsampling images instead of Core Image.
- Unless you're already working with **`vImage`**,
  the extra work necessary to use the low-level Accelerate APIs
  probably isn't justified in most circumstances.
