`NSPredicate` is a Foundation class that specifies how data should be fetched or filtered. Its query language, which is like a cross between a SQL `WHERE` clause and a regular expression, provides an expressive, natural language interface to define logical conditions on which a collection is searched.

It's easier to show `NSPredicate` in use, rather than talk about it in the abstract, so we're going to revisit the example data set used in the [`NSSortDescriptor` article](http://nshipster.com/nssortdescriptor/):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><tt>index</tt></th>
      <th>0</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>firstName</tt></td>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>Charlie</td>
      <td>Quentin</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>lastName</tt></td>
      <td>Smith</td>
      <td>Jones</td>
      <td>Smith</td>
      <td>Alberts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>age</tt></td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>27</td>
      <td>33</td>
      <td>31</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

~~~{objective-c}
@interface Person : NSObject
@property NSString *firstName;
@property NSString *lastName;
@property NSNumber *age;
@end

@implementation Person

- (NSString *)description {
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", self.firstName, self.lastName];
}

@end

#pragma mark -

NSArray *firstNames = @[ @"Alice", @"Bob", @"Charlie", @"Quentin" ];
NSArray *lastNames = @[ @"Smith", @"Jones", @"Smith", @"Alberts" ];
NSArray *ages = @[ @24, @27, @33, @31 ];

NSMutableArray *people = [NSMutableArray array];
[firstNames enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
    Person *person = [[Person alloc] init];
    person.firstName = firstNames[idx];
    person.lastName = lastNames[idx];
    person.age = ages[idx];
    [people addObject:person];
}];

NSPredicate *bobPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"firstName = 'Bob'"];
NSPredicate *smithPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"lastName = %@", @"Smith"];
NSPredicate *thirtiesPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"age >= 30"];

// ["Bob Jones"]
NSLog(@"Bobs: %@", [people filteredArrayUsingPredicate:bobPredicate]);

// ["Alice Smith", "Charlie Smith"]
NSLog(@"Smiths: %@", [people filteredArrayUsingPredicate:smithPredicate]);

// ["Charlie Smith", "Quentin Alberts"]
NSLog(@"30's: %@", [people filteredArrayUsingPredicate:thirtiesPredicate]);

## Using `NSPredicate` with Collections

Foundation provides methods to filter `NSArray` / `NSMutableArray` & `NSSet` / `NSMutableSet` with predicates.

Immutable collections, `NSArray` & `NSSet`, have the methods `filteredArrayUsingPredicate:` and `filteredSetUsingPredicate:` which return an immutable collection by evaluating a predicate on the receiver.

Mutable collections, `NSMutableArray` & `NSMutableSet` have the method `filterUsingPredicate:`, which removes any objects that evaluate to `FALSE` when running the predicate on the receiver.

`NSDictionary` can use predicates by filtering its keys or values (both `NSArray` objects). `NSOrderedSet` can either create new ordered sets from a filtered `NSArray` or `NSSet`, or alternatively, `NSMutableSet` can simply `removeObjectsInArray:`, passing objects filtered with the _negated_ predicate.

## Using `NSPredicate` with Core Data

`NSFetchRequest` has a `predicate` property, which specifies the logical conditions under which managed objects should be retrieved. The same rules apply, except that predicates are evaluated by the persistent store coordinator within a managed object context, rather than collections being filtered in-memory.

## Predicate Syntax

### Substitutions

> - `%@` is a var arg substitution for an object value—often a string, number, or date.
> - `%K` is a var arg substitution for a key path.

~~~{objective-c}
NSPredicate *ageIs33Predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"%K = %@", @"age", @33];

// ["Charlie Smith"]
NSLog(@"Age 33: %@", [people filteredArrayUsingPredicate:ageIs33Predicate]);
~~~

> - `$VARIABLE_NAME` is a value that can be substituted with `NSPredicate -predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:`.

~~~{objective-c}
NSPredicate *namesBeginningWithLetterPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"(firstName BEGINSWITH[cd] $letter) OR (lastName BEGINSWITH[cd] $letter)"];

// ["Alice Smith", "Quentin Alberts"]
NSLog(@"'A' Names: %@", [people filteredArrayUsingPredicate:[namesBeginningWithLetterPredicate predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:@{@"letter": @"A"}]]);
~~~

### Basic Comparisons

> - `=`, `==`: The left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.
> - `>=`, `=>`: The left-hand expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand expression.
> - `<=`, `=<`: The left-hand expression is less than or equal to the right-hand expression.
> - `>`: The left-hand expression is greater than the right-hand expression.
> - `<`: The left-hand expression is less than the right-hand expression.
> - `!=`, `<>`: The left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.
> - `BETWEEN`: The left-hand expression is between, or equal to either of, the values specified in the right-hand side. The right-hand side is a two value array (an array is required to specify order) giving upper and lower bounds. For example, `1 BETWEEN { 0 , 33 }`, or `$INPUT BETWEEN { $LOWER, $UPPER }`.

### Basic Compound Predicates

> - `AND`, `&&`: Logical `AND`.
> - `OR`, `||`: Logical `OR`.
> - `NOT`, `!`: Logical `NOT`.

### String Comparisons

> String comparisons are by default case and diacritic sensitive. You can modify an operator using the key characters c and d within square braces to specify case and diacritic insensitivity respectively, for example firstName BEGINSWITH[cd] $FIRST_NAME.

> - `BEGINSWITH`: The left-hand expression begins with the right-hand expression.
> - `CONTAINS`: The left-hand expression contains the right-hand expression.
> - `ENDSWITH`: The left-hand expression ends with the right-hand expression.
> - `LIKE`: The left hand expression equals the right-hand expression: `?` and `*` are allowed as wildcard characters, where `?` matches 1 character and `*` matches 0 or more characters.
> - `MATCHES`:  The left hand expression equals the right hand expression using a regex-style comparison according to ICU v3 (for more details see the [ICU User Guide for Regular Expressions](http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp)).

### Aggregate Operations

#### Relational Operations

> - `ANY`, `SOME`: Specifies any of the elements in the following expression. For example, `ANY children.age < 18`.
> - `ALL`: Specifies all of the elements in the following expression. For example, `ALL children.age < 18`.
> - `NONE`: Specifies none of the elements in the following expression. For example, `NONE children.age < 18`. This is logically equivalent to `NOT (ANY ...)`.
> - `IN`: Equivalent to an SQL `IN` operation, the left-hand side must appear in the collection specified by the right-hand side. For example, `name IN { 'Ben', 'Melissa', 'Nick' }`.

#### Array Operations

> - `array[index]`: Specifies the element at the specified index in `array`.
> - `array[FIRST]`: Specifies the first element in `array`.
> - `array[LAST]`: Specifies the last element in `array`.
> - `array[SIZE]`: Specifies the size of `array`.

### Boolean Value Predicates

> - `TRUEPREDICATE`: A predicate that always evaluates to `TRUE`.
> - `FALSEPREDICATE`: A predicate that always evaluates to `FALSE`.

## `NSCompoundPredicate`

We saw that `AND` & `OR` can be used in predicate format strings to create compound predicates. However, the same can be accomplished using an `NSCompoundPredicate`.

For example, the following predicates are equivalent:

~~~{objective-c}
[NSCompoundPredicate andPredicateWithSubpredicates:@[[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"age > 25"], [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"firstName = %@", @"Quentin"]]];

[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"(age > 25) AND (firstName = %@)", @"Quentin"];
~~~

While the syntax string literal is certainly easier to type, there are occasions where you may need to combine existing predicates. In these cases, `NSCompoundPredicate -andPredicateWithSubpredicates:` & `-orPredicateWithSubpredicates:` is the way to go.

## `NSComparisonPredicate`

Similarly, if after reading [last week's article](http://nshipster.com/nsexpression/) you now find yourself with more `NSExpression` objects than you know what to do with, `NSComparisonPredicate` can help you out.

Like `NSCompoundPredicate`, `NSComparisonPredicate` constructs an `NSPredicate` from subcomponents—in this case, `NSExpression`s on the left and right hand sides.
Analyzing its class constructor provides a glimpse into the way `NSPredicate` format strings are parsed:

~~~{objective-c}
+ (NSPredicate *)predicateWithLeftExpression:(NSExpression *)lhs
							 rightExpression:(NSExpression *)rhs
									modifier:(NSComparisonPredicateModifier)modifier
										type:(NSPredicateOperatorType)type
									 options:(NSUInteger)options
~~~

#### Parameters

> - `lhs`: The left hand expression.
> - `rhs`: The right hand expression.
> - `modifier`: The modifier to apply. (`ANY` or `ALL`)
> - `type`: The predicate operator type.
> - `options`: The options to apply. For no options, pass `0`.

### `NSComparisonPredicate` Types

~~~{objective-c}
enum {
   NSLessThanPredicateOperatorType = 0,
   NSLessThanOrEqualToPredicateOperatorType,
   NSGreaterThanPredicateOperatorType,
   NSGreaterThanOrEqualToPredicateOperatorType,
   NSEqualToPredicateOperatorType,
   NSNotEqualToPredicateOperatorType,
   NSMatchesPredicateOperatorType,
   NSLikePredicateOperatorType,
   NSBeginsWithPredicateOperatorType,
   NSEndsWithPredicateOperatorType,
   NSInPredicateOperatorType,
   NSCustomSelectorPredicateOperatorType,
   NSContainsPredicateOperatorType,
   NSBetweenPredicateOperatorType
};
typedef NSUInteger NSPredicateOperatorType;
~~~

### `NSComparisonPredicate` Options

> - `NSCaseInsensitivePredicateOption`: A case-insensitive predicate. You represent this option in a predicate format string using a [c] following a string operation (for example, "NeXT" like[c] "next").
> - `NSDiacriticInsensitivePredicateOption`: A diacritic-insensitive predicate. You represent this option in a predicate format string using a [d] following a string operation (for example, "naïve" like[d] "naive").
> - `NSNormalizedPredicateOption`: Indicates that the strings to be compared have been preprocessed. This option supersedes NSCaseInsensitivePredicateOption and NSDiacriticInsensitivePredicateOption, and is intended as a performance optimization option. You represent this option in a predicate format string using a [n] following a string operation (for example, "WXYZlan" matches[n] ".lan").
> - `NSLocaleSensitivePredicateOption`: Indicates that strings to be compared using `<`, `<=`, `=`, `=>`, `>` should be handled in a locale-aware fashion. You represent this option in a predicate format string using a `[l]` following one of the `<`, `<=`, `=`, `=>`, `>` operators (for example, "straße" >[l] "strasse").

## Block Predicates

Finally, if you just can't be bothered to learn the `NSPredicate` format syntax, you can go through the motions with `NSPredicate +predicateWithBlock:`.

~~~{objective-c}
NSPredicate *shortNamePredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithBlock:^BOOL(id evaluatedObject, NSDictionary *bindings) {
            return [[evaluatedObject firstName] length] <= 5;
        }];

// ["Alice Smith", "Bob Jones"]
NSLog(@"Short Names: %@", [people filteredArrayUsingPredicate:shortNamePredicate]);
~~~

...Alright, that whole dig on `predicateWithBlock:` as being the lazy way out wasn't _entirely_ charitable.

Actually, since blocks can encapsulate any kind of calculation, there is a whole class of queries that can't be expressed with the `NSPredicate` format string (such as evaluating against values dynamically calculated at run-time). And while its possible to accomplish the same using an `NSExpression` with a custom selector, blocks provide a convenient interface to get the job done.

One important note: **`NSPredicate`s created with `predicateWithBlock:` cannot be used for Core Data fetch requests backed by a `SQLite` store.**

`NSPredicate` is, and I know this is said a lot, truly one of the jewels of Cocoa. Other languages would be lucky to have something with half of its capabilities in a third-party library—let alone the standard library. Having it as a standard-issue component affords us as application and framework developers an incredible amount of leverage in working with data.

Together with `NSExpression`, `NSPredicate` reminds us what a treat Foundation is: a framework that is not only incredibly useful, but meticulously architected and engineered, to be taken as inspiration for how we should write our own code.
