Cosmologies seek to create order
by dividing existence into discrete, interdependent parts.
Thinkers in every society throughout history
have posited various arrangements ---
though [Natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number)
being what they are,
there are only so many ways to slice the ontological pie.

There are dichotomies like

</ruby>:
incontrovertible and self-evident (albeit reductive).
There are trinities,
which position man in relation to heaven and earth.
One might divide everything into four,
[like the ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element)
with the elements of
earth, water, air, and fire.
Or you could carve things into five,
[like the Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing_%28Chinese_philosophy%29)

For a moment, ponder the mystical truths of fundamental Swift collection types:

> Arrays are ordered collections of values. \\
> Sets are unordered collections of unique values. \\
> Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.
> <cite>[The Book of Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html)</cite>

Thus compared to the pantheon of
[`java.util` collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html)
or [`std` containers](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/),
Swift offers a coherent coalition of three.
Yet,
just as we no longer explain everyday phenomena strictly in terms of
[humors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism#Four_humors)
or [√¶ther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_%28classical_element%29),
we must reject this formulation.
Such a model is incomplete.

We could stretch our understanding of sets to incorporate
`OptionSet` (as explained in a [previous article](/optionset/)),
but we'd be remiss to try and shoehorn `Range` and `ClosedRange`
into the same bucket as `Array` ---
and that's to say nothing of the panoply of
[Swift Collection Protocols](/swift-collection-protocols)
_(an article in dire need of revision)_.

This week on NSHipster,
we'll take a look at `KeyValuePairs`,
a small collection type
that challenges our fundamental distinctions between
`Array`, `Set`, and `Dictionary`.
In the process,
we'll gain a new appreciation and a deeper understanding
of the way things work in Swift.

<hr/>

<dfn>`KeyValuePairs`</dfn> is a structure in the Swift standard library that ---
_surprise, surprise_ ---
represents a collection of key-value pairs.

```swift
struct KeyValuePairs<Key, Value>: ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral,
                                  RandomAccessCollection
{
  typealias Element = (key: Key, value: Value)
  typealias Index = Int
  typealias Indices = Range<Int>
  typealias SubSequence = Slice<KeyValuePairs>

  <#...#>
}
```

This truncated declaration highlights the defining features of `KeyValuePairs`:

- Its ability to be expressed by a dictionary literal
- Its capabilities as a random-access collection

### Dictionary Literals

[Literals](/swift-literals/)
allow us to represent values directly in source code,
and Swift is rather unique among other languages
by extending this functionality to our own custom types through protocols.

A <dfn>dictionary literal</dfn>
represents a value as mapping of keys and values like so:

```swift
["key": "value"]
```

However, the term
_"dictionary literal"_ is a slight misnomer,
since a sequence of key-value pairs --- not a `Dictionary` ---
are passed to the `ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral` protocol's required initializer:

```swift
protocol ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral {
    associatedtype Key
    associatedtype Value

    init(dictionaryLiteral elements: (Key, Value)...)
}
```

This confusion was amplified by the existence of a `DictionaryLiteral` type,
which was only recently renamed to `KeyValuePairs` in Swift 5.
The name change served to both clarify its true nature
and bolster use as a public API
(and not some internal language construct).

You can create a `KeyValuesPairs` object
with a dictionary literal
(in fact, this is the only way to create one):

```swift
let pairs: KeyValuePairs<String, String> = [
    "Êú®": "wood",
    "ÁÅ´", "fire",
    "Âúü": "ground"
    "Èáë": "metal"
    "Ê∞¥": "water"
]
```

{% info %}

For more information about the history and rationale of this change,
see
[SE-0214: "Renaming the DictionaryLiteral type to KeyValuePairs"](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0214-DictionaryLiteral.md).

{% endinfo %}

### Random-Access Collections

`KeyValuePairs` conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`,
which allows its contents to be retrieved by _(in this case, `Int`)_ indices.
In contrast to `Array`,
`KeyValuePairs` doesn't conform to `RangeReplaceableCollection`,
so you can't append elements of remove individual elements at indices or ranges.
This narrowly constrains `KeyValuePairs`,
such that it's effectively immutable once initialized from a dictionary literal.

These functional limitations are the key to understanding
its narrow application in the standard library.

## KeyValuePairs in the Wild

Across the Swift standard library and Apple SDK,
`KeyValuePairs` are found in just two places:

- A [`Mirror` initializer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mirror/3128579-init)
  ([as discussed previously](/mirror/)):

```swift
struct Mirror {
    init<Subject>(_ subject: Subject,
                  children: KeyValuePairs<String, Any>,
                  displayStyle: DisplayStyle? = nil,
                  ancestorRepresentation: AncestorRepresentation = .generated)
}

typealias RGBA = UInt32
typealias RGBAComponents = (UInt8, UInt8, UInt8, UInt8)

let color: RGBA = 0xFFEFD5FF
let mirror = Mirror(color,
                    children: ["name": "Papaya Whip",
                               "components": (0xFF, 0xEF, 0xD5, 0xFF) as RGBAComponents],
                    displayStyle: .struct)

mirror.children.first(where: { (label, _) in label == "name" })?.value
// "Papaya Whip"
```

- The [`@dynamicCallable` method](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0216-dynamic-callable.md):

```swift
@dynamicCallable
struct KeywordCallable {
  func dynamicallyCall(withKeywordArguments args: KeyValuePairs<String, Int>) -> Int {
    return args.count
  }
}

let object = KeywordCallable()
object(a: 1, 2) // desugars to `object.dynamicallyCall(withKeywordArguments: ["a": 1, "": 2])`
```

On both occasions,
`KeyValuePairs` is employed as an alternative to `[(Key, Value)]`
to enforce restraint by the caller.
Without any other public initializers,
`KeyValuePairs` can only be constructed from dictionary literals,
and can't be constructed dynamically.

## Working with KeyValuePairs Values

If you want to do any kind of work with a `KeyValuePairs`,
you'll first want to convert it into a conventional `Collection` type ---
either `Array` or `Dictionary`.

### Converting to Arrays

`KeyValuePairs` is a `Sequence`,
by virtue of its conformance to `RandomAccessCollection`
(and therefore `Collection`).
When we pass it to the corresponding `Array` initializer,
it becomes an array of its associated `Element` type (`(Key, Value)`).

```swift
let arrayOfPairs: [(Key, Value)] = Array(pairs)
```

Though,
if you just want to iterate over each key-value pair,
it's conformance to `Sequence` means that you can pass it directly to a `for-in` loop:

```swift
for (key, value) in pairs {
    <#...#>
}
```

You can always create an `Array` from a `KeyValuePairs` object,
but creating `Dictionary` is more complicated.

## Converting to Dictionaries

There are four built-in types that conform to `ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral`:

- `Dictionary`
- `NSDictionary`
- `NSMutableDictionary`
- `KeyValuePairs`

Each of the three dictionary types constitutes a
<dfn>[surjective mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function)</dfn>,
such that every value element has one or more corresponding keys.
`KeyValuePairs` is the odd one out:
it instead maintains an ordered list of tuples
that allows for duplicate key associations.

`Dictionary` got a number of convenient initializers in Swift 4
thanks to [SE-0165](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0165-dict.md)
_(thanks, [Nate](/authors/nate-cook/)!)_,
including
`init(uniqueKeysWithValues:)`,
`init(_:uniquingKeysWith:)`, and
`init(grouping:by)`

Consider the following example that
constructs a `KeyValuePairs` object with a duplicate key:

```swift
let pairsWithDuplicateKey: KeyValuePairs<String, String> = [
    "Â§©": "Heaven",
    "Êæ§": "Lake",
    "Êæ§": "Marsh",
    <#...#>
]
```

Attempting to pass this to `init(uniqueKeysWithValues:)`
results in a fatal error:

```swift
Dictionary<String, Int>(uniqueKeysWithValues: Array(pairsWithDuplicateKey))
// Fatal error: Duplicate values for key: 'Êæ§'
```

Instead, you must either specify which value to map
or map

```swift
Dictionary(Array(pairsWithDuplicateKey),
                 uniquingKeysWith: { (first, _) in first })
// ["Êæ§": "Lake", <#...#>]

Dictionary(Array(pairsWithDuplicateKey),
                 uniquingKeysWith: { (_, last) in last })
// ["Êæ§": "Marsh", <#...#>]

Dictionary(grouping: Array(pairsWithDuplicateKey),
           by: { (pair) in pair.value })
// ["Êæ§": ["Lake", "Marsh"], <#...#>]
```

<aside class="parenthetical">
The resolution of `KeyValuePairs` into a `Dictionary`
is reminiscent of a
<dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">conflict-free replicated data type
(<abbr title="conflict-free replicated data type">CRDT</abbr>)</a></dfn>.
</aside>

<hr/>

Outside of its narrow application in the standard library,
`KeyValuePairs` are unlikely to make an appearance in your own codebase.
You're almost always better off going with a simple `[(Key, Value)]` tuple array.

However,
the very existence of
Like all cosmological exceptions,
`KeyValuePairs` is uncomfortable --- at times, even unwelcome ---
but it serves to expand our understanding.

Much as today's [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)
more closely resembles
the cacophony of a
[zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_zoo)
than the
<em lang="grc">musica universalis</em> of
[celestial spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres),
`KeyValuePairs`
challenges our tripartite view of Swift collection types.
But like all cosmological exceptions ---
though uncomfortable or even unwelcome at times ---
it serves to expand our understanding.

That's indeed its key value.
