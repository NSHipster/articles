As we prepare to increment our `NSDateComponents -year` by `1`, it's time once again for NSHipster end-of-the-year Reader Submissions! [Last year](https://gist.github.com/mattt/4148342), we got some [mind-blowing tips and tricks](http://nshipster.com/reader-submissions-new-years-2013/). With the release of iOS 7 & Mavericks, and a year's worth of new developments in the Objective-C ecosystem, there was a ton of new stuff to write about.

Thanks to [Arnaud Coomans](https://github.com/acoomans), [Cédric Luthi](https://github.com/0xced), [David Grandinetti](https://github.com/dbgrandi), [Ell Neal](https://github.com/ellneal), [Eric Allam](https://github.com/rubymaverick), [Erik Kerber](https://github.com/eskerber), [Jim Kubicek](https://github.com/jkubicek), [Joachim Bengtsson](https://github.com/nevyn), [Johannes Lund](https://github.com/Anviking), [Josh Avant](https://github.com/joshavant), [João Prado Maia](https://github.com/jpm), [Justin R.

## GCC Code Block Evaluation C Extension

Let's make this official: **NSHipster's Objective-C trend of 2013 is code block evaluation assignment**. Recommended by both [Jim Kubicek](https://github.com/jkubicek) and [Maximilian Tagher](https://github.com/MaxGabriel) (citing [this blog post](http://cocoa-dom.tumblr.com/post/56517731293/new-thing-i-do-in-code) by [Dominik Wagner](https://github.com/monkeydom)), this trick does wonders to make code cleaner, safer, and more concise.

Behind the magic is a GCC C extension, which causes a code block to return a value if  enclosed within brackets and parentheses.

Watch, as it cuts through this view controller code like butter!

~~~{objective-c}
self.searchBar = ({
    UISearchBar *searchBar = [[UISearchBar alloc] initWithFrame:({
        CGRect frame = self.tableView.frame;
        frame.size.height = 50.0f;
        frame;
    })];
    searchBar.delegate = self;
    searchBar;
});
~~~

This not only segregates configuration details into initialization, but the additional scope allows generic variable names like `frame`, `button`, and `view` to be reused in subsequent initializations. No more `loginButtonFrame = ... / signupButtonFrame = ...`!

If code craftsmanship is important to you, strongly consider making this standard practice in your work. It may look a bit weird at first, but this will very likely become common convention by the end of 2014.

## Default Values with GNU-style Ternary `?:`


The ternary operator, `?`, is shorthand for `if () {...} else {...}`. However, because of how difficult it can be to understand statements with ternary operators at a glance, they are generally dispreferred by veteran coders.

Nonetheless, [Maximilian Tagher](https://github.com/MaxGabriel) offers a lesser-known (yet much-loved by those in-the-know) use of the ternary operator: `?:`, which acts as a convenient way to specify a fallback value to return if the left-hand side is `nil`.

~~~{objective-c}
NSLog(@"%@", @"a" ?: @"b"); // @"a"
NSLog(@"%@", nil ?: @"b"); // @"b"
~~~

This is especially convenient for providing default behavior when a property may not be set:

~~~{objective-c}
dispatch_async(self.completionQueue ?: dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    // ...
});
~~~

The main downside of this approach is that default Xcode project warning settings will raise a warning. You can get around this by wrapping the relevant code block in `#pragma` declarations, but the added LOC nullifies much of the brevity that this approach provides:

~~~{objective-c}
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wgnu"
self.name = name ?: @"Unknown";
#pragma clang diagnostic pop
~~~

## `@import`

[Vadim Shpakovski](https://github.com/shpakovski) reminds us of one of the more obscure additions to LLVM 5.0, the `@import` keyword. No more are the days of `Xcode ▹ Project ▹ TARGETS ▹ General ▹ Linked Frameworks and Libraries ▹ +`. With `@import`, the Xcode will automatically link `MapKit`, `CoreData`, or any other referenced framework as necessary. Even `Prefix.pch` benefits, sporting a svelte new physique:

~~~{objective-c}
@import UIKit;
@import Foundation;
@import CoreGraphics;
~~~

## Customizing MKMapView Tiles

[Justin R. Miller](https://github.com/incanus), of [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com) fame, brings to our attention what is perhaps the most important feature in iOS 7 mapping: custom tile overlays:

> Relatively little-known feature of iOS 7: you can turn off Apple's own maps now with `MKTileOverlay`, `MKTileOverlayRenderer`, and `canReplaceMapContent`, unlike you could before with Apple or (pre-iOS 6) Google. And check out [MBXMapKit](http://github.com/mapbox/mbxmapkit) if you'd like to do it in one line of code.

## Thoughtbot's Blog Post on MapKit Performance

Speaking of iOS maps, [João Prado Maia](https://github.com/jpm) cites an amazing blog post by [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com), ["How To Efficiently Display Large Amounts of Data on iOS Maps"](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-handle-large-amounts-of-data-on-maps) by [Theodore Calmes](https://twitter.com/theocalmes). Consider it a must-read if you plan to do any significant iCartography in 2014.

## NSAttributedString + HTML in iOS 7

Shifting gears a little bit, [Eric Allam](https://github.com/rubymaverick) remarks that `NSAttributedString` can do HTML now in iOS 7 with the new [`NSHTMLTextDocumentType`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/NSAttributedString_UIKit_Additions/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011688) document type attribute. Combine with [MMMarkdown](https://github.com/mdiep/MMMarkdown) for ridiculously easy [Markdown rendering in a `UITextView`](http://initwithfunk.com/blog/2013/09/29/easy-markdown-rendering-with-nsattributedstring-on-ios-7/).

## Launch Arguments & User Defaults

Offering another tip, [Vadim Shpakovski](https://github.com/shpakovski) calls our attention to the relationship between launch arguments and `NSUserDefaults`:

The command line argument `-TestFeatureEnabled YES` can be checked in code with `[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] boolForKey:@"TestFeatureEnabled"]`. This is useful for debugging development builds.

## Woes of a Missing `UIViewAnimationCurve` Value

[Thomas Visser](https://github.com/Thomvis) bemoans his pick for least awesome Objective-C development in 2013:

> In iOS7, the animation of the keyboard show/hide changed. Its duration and, most notably, its curve is different from previous iOS versions. As before, if you want to animate something with the keyboard, you can listen to `UIKeyboardWillShowNotification`/`UIKeyboardWillHideNotification` and use the values from the `userInfo` dictionary to coordinate your animations with the keyboard. The `userInfo` dictionary contains the keyboard's begin frame, end frame, animation curve and animation duration.

> However, in iOS 7, the animation curve is an undefined value, meaning that it is not one of the 4 defined values of `UIViewAnimationCurve`. Instead, its value is `7`. This is a problem if you want to use the same curve in your own animation, because such a curve is not defined. The work-around, [as discussed on the Apple forums](https://devforums.apple.com/message/878410#878410), is to manually translate the `UIViewAnimationCurve` to a `UIViewAnimationOptions` value. From the definition of `UIViewAnimationOptions`, we learn that this translation is done by shifting the curve value 16 times to the left: `option = curve << 16`. This works great, but shouldn't be necessary. I hope Apple will add this mysterious 5th curve to the definitions in a future iOS update.

## Injecting Analytics on Outgoing Links

[David Grandinetti](https://github.com/dbgrandi) has a tip for apps that want to track outgoing links from within an app: override `AppDelegate -openURL:`:

~~~{objective-c}
-(BOOL)openURL:(NSURL *)url{
    if ([[url scheme] hasPrefix:@"http"]) {
        [[GAI sharedInstance].defaultTracker sendView:[url absoluteString]];
    }
    return [super openURL:url];
}
~~~

In this example, this information is being sent to Google Analytics, but one could easily adapt this approach for any analytics provider.

## Reviving the Look-and-Feel of iOS 6 in Your App with One Weird Trick (UI Designers _hate_ it!)

Still resisting the aesthetics of this year's iOS makeover? [Kamil Pyć](https://github.com/PycKamil) shows us how to act as if iOS 7 never happened:

~~~{objective-c}
[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:@YES forKey:@"UIUseLegacyUI"]
~~~

> And, of course, following up from a previous tip, since `NSUserDefaults` is tied to launch arguments, this can also be specified on launch. Keep this tucked in the back of your mind—this could make for a simple yet effective April Fool's joke.

## Detecting Category Method Collisions

Categories are great, but suffer from that same original sin of Objective-C: lack of name-spacing. Duplicate method declarations in categories interact in undefined ways, and may lead to difficult-to-debug behavior.

Fortunately, [Cédric Luthi](https://github.com/0xced) shows us how to tell if any category methods are getting up in one another's business:

> Set the `OBJC_PRINT_REPLACED_METHODS` environment variable to `YES` in order to automatically log all methods that are smashed by categories.

## A .plist of Emoji, Grouped by Category

In an encore submission, Cédric brings us a  [.plist file of Emoji grouped by category](https://gist.github.com/mattt/8185075) (mirrored from CloudApp to Gist in order to be more searchable). 😄👍

## Quickly Determining the Type of Image Data

Here's a simple function from [Nolan O'Brien](https://github.com/NSProgrammer) that can be used to determine the type of image data based on the first couple bytes of the header:

~~~{objective-c}
static inline NSPUIImageType NSPUIImageTypeFromData(NSData *imageData) {
    if (imageData.length > 4) {
        const unsigned char * bytes = [imageData bytes];

        if (bytes[0] == 0xff &&
            bytes[1] == 0xd8 &&
            bytes[2] == 0xff)
        {
            return NSPUIImageType_JPEG;
        }

        if (bytes[0] == 0x89 &&
            bytes[1] == 0x50 &&
            bytes[2] == 0x4e &&
            bytes[3] == 0x47)
        {
            return NSPUIImageType_PNG;
        }
    }

    return NSPUIImageType_Unknown;
}
~~~

## Print KVO Context

Once again, showing off his unmatched knowledge of Objective-C internals, Cédric shares this extremely useful tip for debugging [Key-Value Observing](http://nshipster.com/key-value-observing/).

> Print which [context](https://gist.github.com/ddribin/5158614#comment-798104) is passed to `observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:` in lldb.

>Say you have declared a context like this:

~~~{objective-c}
static const void *MyFooContext = &MyFooContext;
~~~

> ...and you want to to know what context it is when you are inside

~~~{objective-c}
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath
                      ofObject:(id)object
                        change:(NSDictionary *)change
                       context:(void *)context
~~~

> You can do this:

~~~
(lldb) image lookup -a `context`
      Address: MyApp[0x00026258] (MyApp.__DATA.__data + 4)
      Summary: MyFooContext
~~~

## Creating a KeyPath from Selectors

On the subject of Key-Value Coding, [Pitiphong Phongpattranont](https://github.com/pitiphong-p) offers this useful function that builds a keypath from a variable list of selectors:

~~~{objective-c}
inline NSString * PTPKeyPathForSelectors(SEL selector, ...) {
  if (!selector) {
    return nil;
  }

  NSMutableArray *selectors = [NSMutableArray array];
  va_list args;
  va_start(args, selector);
  SEL arg = selector;
  do {
    [selectors addObject:NSStringFromSelector(arg)];
  } while((arg = va_arg(args, SEL)));
  va_end(args);

  return [selectors componentsJoinedByString:@"."];
}
~~~

~~~{objective-c}
NSString *keyPath = PTPKeyPathForSelectors(@selector(data), @selector(name), nil);
// => @"data.name"
~~~

## Nomad CLI Utilities

And finally, [Matthew Teece](https://github.com/mteece) gives a shout-out to [Nomad](http://nomad-cli.com), a world-class collection of command-line utilities—specifically, [Houston](https://github.com/nomad/houston), which can send and manage push notifications from the command line, or within your Ruby application.

~~~{bash}
$ apn push "<token>" -c /path/to/cert.pem -m "Hello!"
~~~
